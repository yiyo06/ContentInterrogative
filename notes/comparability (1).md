### General Thoughs about Comparability

----

#### Evans (2020)

- why the comparability problem is central in typology

  - 417: as Croft (1995:88) (in Shibatani&Bynon eds. 1995:85-144 in bib):

  > “**The problem of cross- linguistic comparison is essentially how to identify two grammatical phenomena in two different languages as the ‘same’ thing**, for example adjective or subject. This is a central issue for any sort of linguistic analysis, and yet it has often been taken for granted. However, one cannot even begin to do typological analysis with addressing this problem, and so it has been addressed on numerous occasions in the typological literature.”

- 418:

> every datapoint in a modern linguistic database like WALS depends on having a **clear language-independent operationalisation** of the phenomenon at hand in a way that ensures comparability across what the same entry (say, 'present tense' etc) means across different languages, and sufficient data and analysis in the language-specific source to enable a clear ruling.
>
> the need for rigorously defined comparisons which are able to decide what counts as relevant, in a particular language, to our cross-linguistic claim

> not a new problem: since the birth of structuralism there has been a tension between **privileging language-internal criteria** ('analysing a language on its own terms', which may produce entities or phenomena claimed to be unique in that language) and instead invoking cross-linguistic criteria that establish some level of comparability between systems.
>
> this involves **using functional or semantic criteria** that abstract **away from the morphosyntactic particularities** of individual language
>
> doubt: how far one can tie phenomena at the language-specific level to “comparative concepts” which can be used in cross-linguistic comparison



#### Haspelmath commenting on Evans (2020)

- https://dlc.hypotheses.org/2421
- Linguistics is thus similar to biological comparison in that it has both **homologies** (= similarities due to inheritance) and **analogies** (= similarities due to common function, or some other cause) (see Bromham 2020)
- Haspelmah claims that the problem of "comparability" is already solved, as long as the constrast between dc and cc is clear, which against what alleged by Evans (2020), Stassen (2011) and Croft (1995) that this problem will never go away.
- Defining is a methodological **prerequisite** to scientific comparison, but it is not a “problem” [...] **defining comparative concepts is easy** and unproblematic
- (Levinson&Evans 2010:2737): "It doesn’t follow that comparison is impossible, only that* **it has to be undertaken in an auxiliary language designed to generalize** over language-specific categories."
- (Bromham 2020:11-12): the typological concept is similar to analogous biological concepts , in that they are defined by their functiona, and not structurally
- **the real deep problem of linguistic:**  
  - The fact that generative linguists do not worry about comparability but simply assume that all languages make use of **the same innate building blocks** (the substantive of Universal grammar; Croft (2021) calls this "skeleton model"); 
  - generative grammarians think that different criteria can be used for different languages, and “depth of analysis” is a prerequisite of comparison; 
  - comparison of grammars is like comparison of chemical compounds: We first have to break them down into their constituent elements before we can compare them properly
  - The hypothesized “bones” of the skeleton model are **natural kinds** (Aronoff 2016)
- criticizes **gram-type** as cc (Bybee&Dahl 1989, Dahl 2016 below) as "observed clusters are **empirical research results**, whereas comparative concepts are prerequisites to comparison. In order to find clusters, we need to have uniformly defined comparative concepts"
  - empirical results are always preliminary, and "success" is not certain -- and methdological rigour requires objectively defined cc. Thus it does not make sense to require that comparative concepts **must** be based on successfully demonstrated clusters



#### Cysouw (2007:ch.2) ("Building semantic maps")

2: 

- inherent cross-linguistic variability (eng. *fly* vs. deu. *fliegen* not identical in all their nuances and idiomatic usages)
- the same cross-language incompatibility also exists at all other levels of language structure -- what should be compared with what, when everything is different?
- solution: **tertium comparationis** -- in the form of a semantically or functionally defined extra-linguistic concept, as the basis of the cross-linguistic comparison

3:

- **analytical primitive** (in semantic maps): 
  - concept that is need for te analysis of a particular set of data; 
  - equal to **function** referring to the points of comparison in semantic maps of Haspelmath
  - primitives are primarily meant to be **minimal elements** of attested linguistic variation
  - refrain from any claims about them being "universal" primitives of language structure
  - a particular primitive is used for the analysis of a particular set of data at hand; it might be refined by the further development of the field
  - Analytical primitives minimally have to be **cross-linguistically inter- pretable entities**
  - In contrast, the term ***category*** will be used here to refer to language-specific elements of linguistic structure
  -  In the process of typological comparison, the set of analytical primitives is used to **describe the meanings or functions of the language-specific categories**
  - Cross-linguistic identity is always just a matter of the **granularity** of analysis
- 4: three things needed to make a model of the linguistic variation in the form of a semantic map
  - 1: **a set of analytical primitives** is needed as the basis for corss-linguistic comparison
  - 2: **a set of empricial relation**, "attested as combined into the meaning of a language-particular category" or "unattested as such", is needed between every pair of primitives
  - 3: a **technique** to display any structure in these relations
    - In most cases, the graphical display is just a coarse summary of the data, expelling much of the available variation (overgeneralising) or suggesting much more than is actually attested (undergeneralising)



#### Moravcsik (2007)



#### Round&Corbett (2020)

- what kinds of concepts linguists (should) use to compare languages

  



#### Haspelmath commenting on Round&Corbett (2020)

- https://dlc.hypotheses.org/2415
- R&C is right about that **prototype categories** for comparison is not stable and similar to 'stereotype'
- R&C is wrong about that Haspelmath says wants to 'rebuild' the linguistics and linguistics is isolated



#### Haspelmath commenting on Spike (2020)

- https://dlc.hypotheses.org/2410
- each languages is structurally unique
- **comparative concepts are observer-made concepts that are not thought of as part of a language** – and comparative concepts like picture stimuli or Bible passages make it even clearer that they are **instruments of research**, and not research results
- Spike: 
  - if cross-linguistic categories have a history of “being used in successful inferences”, that vindicates them
  -  linguistic categories may be “homeostatic property clusters”
- [some linguistics]mistake linguistic categories for innate parts of the human mind ([“natural kinds”](https://dlc.hypotheses.org/1012))
- there is a huge difference between categories of phenomena that exist in the world before we start observing them, and **concepts that we as observers use in order to classify phenomena that do not fall into clear categories for the time being**
- successful usage of cc: Dahl (1985) and Bybee et al. (1994)
- comparative concepts like “clan” (a example of social categories /anthropology) are not discoveries, but instruments for research
- the crucial distinction between comparative concepts (as **instruments of research**) and language-particular descriptive categories (as **discoveries**)

### Categorical Particularism

----



#### Haspelmath (2007, 2010a)

- Dryer (1996, 1997), Croft (2001)

- **descriptive categories** (language-particular) vs. **comparative concept** (cross-linguistic)

- comparative concepts are based on other universal applicable concepts: conceptual-semantic, general formal
  	- cc usually contains a semantic component
  	- ccs are not hypotheses to be verified, just a tool for research (Lazard 2008:5)
  	- not right or wrong, just more or less productive for subdivisions and generalizations (2010:678)
  	- example: subject is not a cross-linguistic category since the criteria differ 
  	
  	

#### Haspelmath (2010a)

- **categorial universalism**:
  - 663: generative linguistic: to identify **crosslinguistic categories** , a substantial set of universally available (e.g. adj)(X) (more history in 675-676)
  - research identifies a category, e.g. adj, then examine the ways in which the properties of the category vary across languages.
  - it is sometimes assumed that particular categories are universal in the sense not only of being universally available, but also of being universally instantiated.
  - 664: merely taken from an influential grammatical tradition
  - 666: categories in particular languages instantiate crosslinguistic categories, and they can thus be equated across languages.
- 664: gramamtical categories are either universally available, or universally instantiated
- **categorial particularism**:
  - each language has its own categories; a set of **descriptive categories** to describe a language
  - These categories are often similar across languages, but the similarities and differences between languages cannot be captured by equating categories across languages.
  - language-particular analyses
  - **comparative concept**: concepts specifically designed for the purpose of comparison that are independent of descriptive categories.
  - 679-680: when confronted with a previously undescribed phenomenon, we create a descriptive category for it, and if we want to compare it with other phenomena, we adjust our comparative concepts in such a way as to arrive at the most insightful comparisons and the most interesting generalizations.
- 665-666: **comparative concept**
  - crosslinguistic comparison of morphosyntactic patterns **cannot be based on** **formal patterns** (because these are too diverse), but has to be based on **universal conceptual- semantic concepts**
  - **created** by comparative linguists for the specific purpose of crosslinguistic comparison. Unlike descriptive categories, they are not part of particular language systems and are not needed by descriptive linguists or by speakers
  - not pshchological real, not right or wrong
  - often labeled in the same way as dc
  - universally applicable, defined based on: universal conceptual-semantic concepts, general formal concepts, and other comparative concepts
  - es, and they can thus be equated across languages. On the view presented here, the fact that two language-particular categories both match a comparative concept just means that they are **similar in the relevant respect**, but not that they are ‘the same’ in any sense
  - 673: created by comparative linguists for the purpose of formulating readily testable crosslinguistic generalizations
  - 673: Comparative concepts allow linguists to identify comparable grammatical phenomena in different languages
  - 674: labels with **ordinary lower-case spelling**
  - Comrie (1976:10) first one to suggest this writing
  - 674: term for cc -- more semantic terms
  - 678: cc can only be more or less **productive**, in that they allow the formulation of more or less interesting subdivisions and generalizations
  - 680: since the choice of comparative concepts depends on one’s goals, and comparative linguists will always have a multiplicity of goals, there will never be a single (‘standard’) list of such concepts.
  - 680: comparative concepts often cross-cut linguistic categories
  - 680: . Comparative concepts are simply a different kind of general notion from linguistic categories
  - 681: Comparative linguists are willing, and indeed forced, to disregard the structural coherence of language-particular systems, and just focus on the properties that they see through the lens of their comparative concepts.
  - 677: comparative concepts based on fewer factors seem to have greater chances of leading to deeper insights (*<u>general/fuzzy enough to cover all languages</u>*)
- 666-668: **descriptive categories**
  - language-particular
  - to gain insights into the inner workings of the language
  - argument/reason: the criteria used for identifying are themselves language-particular
  - words in one language are often in semantic many-to-many relationships with words in another language
  - These lexical meanings are comparative concepts, and the meanings of individual languages are language-particular semantic categories.
  - 674: **grammatical labels with an initial capital** refer to language-particular descriptive categories
  - 680: These language-particular categories have properties that are not only much more specific than the related comparative concept, but are also additionally used in ways that are quite incompatible with the definition of the comparative concept. 
- 669: **crosslinguistic categories** cannot be the basis for comparative linguistics
  - a new language presents with something new
  - there is a large periphery of construction types that are not readily identifiabl across languages.
  - from influential framworks or languages
- 670: a Verb (dc) may be an adjective (cc) for the purpose of crosslinguistic comparison
- 678: Language-particular categories are defined formally, whereas general-level concepts may contain semantic el- ements (cf. Huddlestone&Pullum 2002:31-33)
- 678: Reesink 2008: **emic** -- dc, **etic** -- cc



#### Haspelmath (2010b) as the reply Newmeyer (2010):

- subject
  N’s own concrete proposal for defining ‘subject’ (N 2010:12) is also a possible cc.

- it is unclear how one can draw up such a list of core proproties

- such a definition is unlikely to be found useful in language-particular studies; dc are normally defined in terms of specific conditions, not in vague quantitative terms 

  <u>(*like N’s “more properties than” in P. 692*?)</u>.

- semantic roles

  - it is never be a problem in a typological context
  - it is only when one tries to describe particular languages with a single universal set of semantic roles that one runs into problems
    does not reject the “interplay”, but sees it differently



### Categorical Universalism

-----



#### Universal Grammar? UG-based skeleton model (Croft 2021) (see Haspelmath https://dlc.hypotheses.org/2421)



#### Newmeyer (2007)

- **the first explicit claims** in recent work that structural categories cannot be equated across languages are found in **Dryer (1996, 1997)**, where it is argued that grammatical relations and word classes in a crosslinguistic sense are “at most a convenient fiction” (Dryer 1997: 117)
- Then **Croft (2001:34), Haspelmath (2007)**
- N uses **universal concepts** to refer to universal substance-based entities, or cc.
- 136: Typological generalizations need to make reference to the specific form in which these universal concepts are realized as well

​	(*<u>similar sense with mixed functional-formal definition</u>*)

- problems with a **purely semantically-based typology**
  - many different theories of meaning
  - footnote in P.139: the debates about whether **two element in the same languages** are members of the same formal category are more widespread than those of in different languages. By parity of argument, Dryer, Haspelmath, Croft should reject the existence of language-paritular formal categories [**dc**], which they do not.
  - lexical categorial assignments are often problematic in a theory with crosslinguistic formal categories, they are no less so in a theory with universal concepts
- 147: against Dryer, Croft, Haspelmath's principle argument agsinst crosslinguistic formal categories is based on the apparent dramatic differences manifested by the "same" category from language to language
  - "not only are **similar categories in two languages** never identical, but languages also often exhibit **categories that are not even particularly similar** to categories in other languages" (Haspelmath 2007: 122, 123).
  - N believes that such a view greatly **exaggerates** the grammatical differences that need to be attributed to the same formal category from one language to the next
  - mistaken from applying the **distributional method**




#### Newmeyer (2010)

- there are cross-linguistic categories suitable both in cross-linguistic studies and in language-particular description (***Beck 2016?***)

- cc and dc are problematic

- suggests “**interplay** between the language-particular and language-independent”

- H’s proposing of cc actually undercuts his assertion that cc can only be more or less productive, in that they allow the formulation of more or less subdivisions and generalizations (H 2010:678)

- H’s generalizations of adj. order and reflexive pronouns involve the notion ‘subject’, which shows his inconsistency

- Problems of cc: 
  - almost all putatively universal semantic roles
  - toward H’s adj.: a purely semantic definition is inadequate
  - Undefined cc, problematic when combining conceptual-semantic concepts and elementary formal constructs, e.g., clause. — since H has committed himself to the most skeletal ontology imaginable
  - inadequate definition of ‘word’
  - very few typologist see a disconnect between typological generalizations and language-particular descriptive analysis
  - inappropriate to take cross-group comparison in the social science as a model for linguistics (H: the independence of cc from structural systems in not unique)

  

### Concern/suggestions to Categorical Particularism

----



#### LaPolla (2016)

- The **labels used for the categories** that emerge from the analysis may be those used in the description of other languages, as long as there is enough of a “**family resemblance**” between the two categories. 

  (*kinda similar to N’s “more properties” in P.692?*) 

  <u>(*a milder view than H’s and N’s*) (*similar to Beck 2016's portable term*)</u>

  - not saying there are qual or there are cross-linguistic categories! simply saying **the similarity in some way allows the label of categories for another language**. 
  - in the case of the labeling of descriptive categories, the resemblance should include resemblance in function, but cannot be limited to it — **if no similarity is in form, then the label would not be used**

- Comparative categories are dependent on descriptive categories, as they are idealizations or prototypes formed on the basis of the family resemblances found in the descriptions.

- the grammatical comparative categories often are given the same labels as used in the descriptions

- language use is one type of ostensive act, patterns of behavior which emerge out of communicative interaction that are remembered and used over and over again in different ways.

- There are no global categories, only roles in individual construction which are defined functionally

- as language is seen as arising from the desire to constrain the inferential process in particular ways, then both individual language description and typology can be done by looking at how the languages of interest constrain the inference of a particular aspect of meaning ;“**aspect of meaning**” = “conceptual space” 

  <u>(*similar to N’s “interplay between language-particular and language-specific?*)</u>

- problem of H’s: too free to create categories and apply them at will to languages, using the same labels, even if the language does not manifest the particular feature identified in the label 

  <u>(*L emphasizes the similarity manifested in feature/construction, which H maybe overlooks*)</u> 

  - why it is problematic that classification is solely based on functional grounds: classifying the language as SVO is the same as saying that since a bird flies because of its wings, and a rocket flies, we can classify the rocket as a winged entity.

  - P. 371: criticizes that H mixes those who follow the methodology (of L’s labeling) with those who assumes there are universal categories that just need to be identified in the languages, and then by assuming that positing any connection between the facts of the languages and the comparative categories means one is equating the descriptive categories in different languages. 

    <u>(*H is too radical to deny the connection between form and function*)</u> 

  - examples of L’s labeling of “family resemblance”: /p/ or “ablative” — they are just cc; they are defined for an individual language and generalized to others only to the extent that that is warranted by the facts of the languages.

  - H’s denial of connection between form and function is confusing to non-specialists, does not produce useful results, as it makes language patterns that aren’t similar look similar.

  - no categories should be imposed on the languages. Labels can be borrowed from another languages, as long as there manifests enough “family resemblance” (*both in function and form*) and they are explicitly defined.
  
  

#### Beck 2016

- there are **"portable" terms (descriptive metalanguage)** that are suitable both for te description of specfic languages and for crosslinguistic comparison 

  <u>(*similar to LaPolla 2016 "labeling/family resemblance"*)</u>

- H 2010 treats language-particular description and crosslinguistic comparison work with separate sets of terminology and, potentially, with unrelated conceptual apparatuses.

  - may be somewhat overstated

- the gap between cc and dc can be filled by portable terms, which defined as "cc also include some very specific terms that can, and do, provide useful labels for language-particular descriptions."

- Among those terms that are most often characterized as “language- particular” are those used in the descriptions of specific languages that can only be understood in the context of those descriptions – most obviously, these encompass terms invented for features that are unique to the language or language family being described.

  - e.g.  "alienative" prefix *maq-* in Papantla Totonac

- 398: what H (2010) calls "**categorial particularism**" -- vocabulary used in language-particular description - and much of this means very little outside the context of that description (e.g. "case")

  - but in reality this is just one extreme. There are more portable terms

  - not to say that these (protable) terms represent some kind of reified or abstract category with its own independent [...] reality which is then "instantiated" in particular languages

  - it is simply a statement that there are things that languages do similarly for a variety of reasons [...], e.g. "eye"

    <u>(*how can one define the degree of "similarity" that allows the same term shared other languages?  as in H 2010b*)</u>

- debates about whether two features with the same descriptive label in two different languages are the "same" or not make (little) sense

  - it does make sense to discuss whether or not the term as defined can be usefully applied to the feature in question, if we have our defintions clear 

    <u>(*same as LaPolla 2016 advocates*)</u>

-  Admittedly, linguistics is a long way from having a large set of clear and consistently-defined portable terminology, but developing this sort of metalanguage is a fundamental part of the scientific enterprise

- inappropriate cc:

  - too abstract: e.g. "alignment"
  - have no relation to the description of specific languages at all: e.g. "dative"

- Descriptions of specific languages are by necessity focused on the specific mappings of meaning/function to form particular to that language, so **comparative concepts that are based on explicit patterns of meaning-form or function-form mappings are most likely to be portable between languages**.

  (*<u>same as LaPollar 2016 emphasis on conformity of function and form</u>*)

- cc based on **structual parallels**, like the definitions of parts of speech, would be based on **homology**, and are likely to be portable and to lend themselves to language-particular description 

  <u>(*seems that Beck considers more about how cc fits the language-particular description*; but why "structural parallel" is more reliable?)</u>

- **Strictly** **functional** comparative concepts (e.g., “possessive construction”, “**information question**”) are based on **analogy**, and are less likely to be applicable to language-particular descriptions of specific structures because they are more abstract and generally cover a wide range of structural types across languages. 

  (*<u>"strictly functional" cc does emphasize less on formal similarity and thus might be described as 'formally' abstract; but contrariwise, using this kind of cc may help to explore the diversity of language structure!</u>*)

- other types of cc **based on semantic** (aktionsart, quantification, cultural categories (kinship, and categories created to facilitate broad-based corsslinguistic comparison (H's dative) become **progressively more abstract** and disconnected from the project of language-particular description, ultimate falling exclusively into the domain of typology. 

  (*<u>Beck is not against a more abstract cc, but he emphasizes that such cc may not be suitable for language-particular description and thus cannot be seen as "portable"</u>*)



#### Dahl 2016

- cc may be better subsumed under the notion of "**generalizing concept**", which is not tied to any specific level of analysis, and that the distinction between what is language-specific and what is crosslinguistic is not absolute 

  (*<u>seems that articles from 2016 are all critizing the absolute disconnection of cc and dc of H and trying to find the connection</u>*)

- language-paricular -- **Individuals**: can be referred to by a proper name

  cc-- **Universals**: whatever non-linguistic entity a common noun correspond to

- the **realist** view: a Universal

  the **conceptualist** view: matches a concept in our minds

  the **nominalist** view: a name of a set of Individuals

- problematics cases:

  - **natural kinds**: no clear characterization as either Individuals or Universals; a set of Individuals that may be restricted in time and space and have propertie that seem to be independent of our minds; but, membeship in this set is not given but changes over time
  - **categories with a type/token dimension**

- problems of comparability:

  - Large parts of the conceptual resources of traditional grammar have been taken over in modern typology, sometimes with little discussion.
  - there is a pervasive vagueness in grammatical terms which blurs the distinction between crosslinguistic and language-specific.

- H saying dc identifying unique entities mirrors that he is probably mainly thinking of morphological categories

- the distinction between **individual categories** and **generalizing concepts** is not necessarily tied to the distinction between descriptions of specific languages and typology or comparative linguistics.

- make little sense to try to determine if a generalizing concept is language-specific or comparative

  (*<u>Dahl 2016 suggests a "general concept" that avoids the absolute distinction between cc and dc</u>*)

- some validity in Newmeyer’s argument (2007: 146) that denying the existence of crosslinguistic formal categories leads to a “solipsist view of grammar” in that we must then conclude that no two speakers can have the same formal categories.

- For Dahl a shocking claim: cc are explicitly said not to be "psychologically real"

- multifunctionality: a property only ascribable to language-specific entity

- **!** The crucial criterion for a **bottom-up typological investigation** is that it builds on comparable crosslinguistic datasets based on primary linguistic data. e.g. parallel text

  - expressions with the same meaning, and more broadly, with the same functions, will have similar distributions in language usage. Working with parallel texts or questionnaires, data points will be locations in those where a linguistic item or feature can be either used or not used.

  -  The set of locations where a certain element E, say the future auxiliary will, occurs in a text T, makes up the distribution of E in T and defines a **DATASET-SPECIFIC PATTERN**.

  - Starting from one or more known “**seed patterns**” we can use **automated methods** to search for **similar pattern**s in other datasets. A set of sufficiently similar patterns forms a **PATTERN CLUSTER** for which a **GENERALIZED DISTRIBUTION** can be defined

  - The distributions of patterns and pattern clusters can be visualized for instance via **MULTI-DIMENSIONAL SCALING (MDS)**. Each location in the corpus be represented as a point in MDS.

  - The distances between points will then depend on the number of shared patterns. Such a space can be called a “**semantic space**”, since data points that represent similar meanings are close to each other.

  - when the members of the cluster represent a sufficiently wide sample of languages, there is reason to postulate what was called a **CROSSLINGUISTIC CATEGORY TYPE** in Dahl (1985) and **CROSSLINGUISTIC GRAM TYPE** in later work (using the term “**gram**” for a language-specific category).

  - in a concrete sense, these clusters or gram types are not primarily entities “constructed” by the researcher to be used for comparisons but objects that are “out there” to be discovered.

  - other markers with similar distributions are then unearthed by automated searches

  - at that point, I know only that these markers cluster in grammatical space without any idea of the principles that govern their use

  - **!** by studying the **contexts** in which they appear, i can form hypotheses about those principles, and in the end, obtain an adequate account of the crosslinguistic type i have found

  - The members of a crosslinguistic gram type are not “the same” in the sense of having totally identical properties or totally identical distributions. They are just **similar enough** to be put in the same bucket. What we expect to observe, however, is that they share a set of **PROTOTYPICAL USES**, where the probability of their use comes close to 1. The **generalized distribution** can be seen as a model for the patterns that are members of the cluster. The degree to which a pattern conforms to the model determines its membership in the cluster; membership will be a graded property. Polycentricity is not excluded and may be necessary to account for polyfunctionality.

    (*<u>P.434-435 seems to describe the methodoly of using parallel text</u>*)

    (*<u>still underscores the similarity; but the degree of "similarity" is still difficult to determine; thus, here a computational approach may be helpful</u>*)

    (<u>***read Dahl&Wälchli 2016!***</u>)



#### Dahl&Wälchli 2016:328-332

- gram, grammatical space (see Dahl 2016:434-445 above!)

- A **gram** (Bybee and Dahl 1989) is a grammatical item in a particular language with specific form and specific meaning and/or function (*<u>dc?</u>*)

  - Haspelmath (https://dlc.hypotheses.org/2421) has criticized this **gram-type** as cc, since "observed clusters are **empirical research results**, whereas comparative concepts are prerequisites to comparison. In order to find clusters, we need to have uniformly defined comparative concepts"

- Cross-linguistically, grams tend to form **clusters** whose members are highly similar in meaning and behavior. Such a cluster can be seen as making up a **gram type**

- gram are not to be confounded with "grammatical categories" 

  (*<u>but where lies the difference between these two terms?</u>*)

- Grams differ in how **transparent** their form is (and hence in how easily they can be identified automatically in texts)

​		(<u>*like diver forms of interrogative construction?*</u>)

-  In less transparent grams it is also often difficult to determine what should be counted as an occurrence of a gram.

- Gram types have more and less **prototypical uses**. The more likely a use is in a gram type, the more prototypical it is

- Gram types are related to the notion of **functional domain** in the sense that prototypical uses of a gram type often reflect a certain functional domain

- Miestamo (2007:293): a **functional domain** is "any domain of related (semantic or pragmatic) functions that (one or more) language(s) encode with the formal means they possess"

- however, taking into consideration also non-typological uses, a gram type can encode more than one functional domain

- Grams can be addressed both **extensionally** and **intensionally**

  - extension(distribution): in a text or in a corpus a gram has a set of occurrences
  - intension: it also has a number of types of uses (senses/functions)
  - The advantage of using **parallel texts** is that this allows us to define grams extensionally and hence to establish gram types and prototypical uses of gram types without having to start with **a priori intensional definitions**.
  -  Once a gram type is established, its prototypical uses can be interpreted intensionally as its “sense”
  -  whereas the functional domain approach goes from meaning to form (**onomasiological**), the gram type approach goes from form to meaning (**semasiological**)
  - Grams can be viewed as points in **grammatical space**. The closer two grams in grammatical space, the more similar their meanings
  - Grammatical space allows us to investigate the **internal diversity** of gram types (density of clusters of points) and the **relationship** between grams of different types (how neatly distinct clusters are)
  - grammatical space is similar to, but no identical with semantic maps, which are sometimes also referred to as conceptual space
  - a semantic map is a graph or a multidimensional space where the basic units/nodes/points are semantic or pragmatic functions whose similarity is reflected by their distance in the graph.

  - Using verse-level alignments in comparing the distribution of elements in the corpus texts means that “having the same distribution” will be interpreted as “occurring in the same verses”.

- identifying clusters of grams:

  - a gram type can be seen as **a cluster of grams represented as points in grammatical space** where the distance between two grams depends on the degree of similarity between their distributions.

  - first to choose a set of "**seed grams**", a set of grams with know distributions that based on out pripr knowledge can be assumed to be members of the same cluster

  - **calculate their genrealized distribution** -- the probability for a member of the set to be represented in each location in the corpus

  - This generalized distribution is the **point of departure** for the search for other grams which are similar enough to be included in the cluster.

  - the result of the search will then be a new set of candidate grams to serve as the basis for calculating a new generalized distribution 

     (*<u>finding all contexts?</u>*)

  - What we do is to exploit **sets of locations** where the members of a cluster tend to behave in **a uniform fashion**.



#### Stassen 2011 (ab Song eds. 2011:90-)

- **mixed functional-formal domain** definitions constitute the best strategy for ensuring cross-linguistic comparability
- Problem of cross-linguistic identification (as Croft 1995:88): "how can we be sure that the data which we select from the languages in the sample form a coherent body of facts?"
- solution: preusuppose a **language-independent definition** of the domain of the enquiry
- language-independent definitions of typological domains cannot be formulated in **purely formal/structural terms**
-  not the aim of linguistic typology to single out those languages in which the phenomena in the domain have a specific formal expression; linguistic typology attempts to present a survey of all the different ways in which languages may encode some linguistically relevant property

​		(*<u>what typology does! exclude the usage of a specific formal expression as the cross-linguistic comparable object</u>*)

- Stassen (1997:616-617): **non-formal domain definition** are even at the basis of typological studies which explicitly situate themselves within a 'formalist' theoretical framework.

- Greenberg (1966c:74):  "I fully realize that in identifying such phenomena in languages of differing structure, one is basically employing **semantic criteria**" 

- Croft (2003a: 14): it would be **too restrictive** to claim that domain definitions should always have their foundation in semantics. Cross-linguistic criteria that have their **basis in pragmatic or discourse-functional notions** are also readily permissible. 

- a cross-linguistic comparison of **phonological** phenomena can never have their grounding in semantics

- better "**external criteria**" than 'semantic' or 'functional' criteria, as it is meant to be in opposition to 'formal' and 'structural' criteria, which can be viewed as 'internal' to natural language systems

- the ‘external’ grounding of the domain **demarcation** is problematic in itself

- domain definitions do not always have to be formulated in terms of ‘primary’ or ‘basic’ external concepts; typologist should be allowed to use 'short-cut' terminology.

  (<u>*similar to H's 2010 of cc*</u>)

- [pure] external criteria are insufficient for the definition of a workable crosslinguistic domain; some suggest a supplement by one or more criteria of a formal nature -- **mixed functional-formal definition**, 

  - as Haspelmath (1997:9): " Purely formal definitions are impractical because there are extremely few, if any, structural (or formal) properties that can be identified and compared across languages. [...] On the other hand, purely functional definitions have the disadvantage that they tend to pick out quite heterogeneous expressions"

-  formal criteria that are included in domain definitions commonly serve the function of **keeping the domain manageable**

- **side-effect** of mixed functional-formal defintion: '**partial typologies**' -- languages with the formal part fall out of the research scope

- the formal criteria are employed to create a subset of the phenomena that the external criteria permit

- (summary from Evans 2020) 
  - there is an **ontological difference** between cc and dc, as well as a **three-way division** between natural kinds, cc, and social categories.
