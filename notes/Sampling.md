<u>***Short Summary***</u>

**Rijkhoff 2007:11-12** Literature of sampling

> Bell (1978) is probably the first major systematic discussion of language sampling, followed by Dryer (1989) and Bybee and her associates (Bybee 1985, Bybee et al. 1994), 
>
> in particular Perkins (1989, 2001). Rijkhoff et al. (1992) and Rijkhoff and Bakker (1998) discuss different kinds of language samples and propose a sampling design procedure for what they call ‘variety samples’ (as opposed to e.g. ‘probability samples’ or ‘random samples’)

> **variety samples**: useful for explorative research -- samples offers a maximum degree of linguistic variation

> **Probability samples**: useful to find correlation pairs or to establish the probability of occurrence of some linguistic phenomenon, pose special problems because they must be free of genetic, areal, cultural and typological bias (Rijkhoff&Bakker 1998:265)

**Croft 2007:80-81** short introduction of variety and probability sampling

> **variety sampling methodology**: Rijkhoff&Bakker 1998
>
> - based on the structure of a genetic language family tree
>
> **probability sampling**: Maslova 2000
>
> - analyzes the current population of languages (and thus language types) as the product of a historical process involving type shifts, modeled as a *Markov process*, and uses this model to provide a statistical evaluation of distributional universals of languages
> - historical dependence of cases

**Bisang ?** Handout about sampling

> Greenberg (1966)'s attempt of sampling: obtain as wide a genetic and areal coverage as possible

- two important criteria for setting up a sample:

  - genetical relatedness of the sample languages
  - areal closeness (language contact and the problem of structural convergence)

- Genetic relatedness:

  -  Samples in which certain families are overrepresented are biased in the sense that some structural types may be too frequent and certain other structural types which are in fact attested may not occur

- Areal proximity:

  - Language contact is another important factor which induces structural convergence even in genetically unrrelated languages
  - According to Rijkhof et al. (1993: 175) pairs of adjacent languages, pairs of languages which are used by the same speech community in different situations and pairs of languages belonging to the same *Sprachbund* are not allowed.

- cultural similarity

- typological similarity

  - problematic

- Bibliographic accessibility

  - arbitrary but very relevant cirterion

- Rijkhof et al. (1993,1998) three types of sampling

  - **variety sample**: 

    - discover the full range of possible variation for expressing a given cognitive-semantic area in the world’s languages.

  - **probability sample**

    - finding correlation pairs; 
    -  finding the probability of occurrence of some linguistic phenomenon.

  - **random sample**

    - not take into account any form of stratification

      

<u>***Overall***</u>

**Bakker 2011 in Song 2011** Language sampling 

> the most outstanding problem is that for about two thirds of the existing languages, no grammar or even a grammatical sketch is currently available

- two fundamentally different classes of typological questions requiring their specific type f sample
  - **probability** that a language is of a specific type
    - genetic relationship & Sprachbund
    - **probability sampl**e in Rijkhoff et al (1993) will be relatively small in size, typically between 50 and 200 languages, and will vary with what is known beforehand about the range of values for the relevant linguistic variables and their stability.
    - preferred type of sample if one wants to apply conclusions drawn from the sample directly to the population in terms of the distribution of the phenomena observed
  - the **variation** among the values for the respective variables that we want to know
    - an initial sample is established which maximizes the genetic or typological diversity of the languages in the sample.
    -  Whereas probability samples tend to be relatively small, and can in fact even be too large for their purpose, **variety samples** tend to be large, and typically contain many hundreds of languages. 
  - random sample:
    -  not (directly) related to genetic affiliation or to areal considerations, and for variables which are highly unstable and show a high level of variation.
    - point: large enough in relation to the complexity of the phenomena under investigation and which is stratified for the parameters of which we know that they may affect the results. 
  - convenience sample:
    - there may be practical circumstances which force a researcher to just grab the data which happen to be available and sufficiently reliable
  - bias:
    - bibliographic bias
      - unavailable or old grammar; strictly based on certain theory
    - genetic bias
      - Genetically related languages are often spoken in the same area. 
    - areal bias
      - same linguistic area; through language contact
      - Balkan, South Asia, Central America
      - Society form and population sizes are more or less related to areal factors, and so is the availability and accessibility of language data
    - typological bias
    - cultural bias: Perkins (1989)
  - small communities experience a higher amount of random genetic drift since there is a higher chance that ‘unlikely’ gene combinations are successful [...] As a result the chance that one might find relatively ‘exotic’ phenomena in languages with only hundreds or a few thousands of speakers is assumed to be greater than in those with tens or hundreds of thousands of speakers, especially when we look at the standard (written) dialect of the latter languages. [...] If this **population size** factor may indeed turn out to be a fundamental one, then a sample, and especially a variety sample, should consistently contain <u>a relative overrepresentation of the smallest languages</u>.
  - Diversity value (Rijkhoff et al. (1993), Rijkhoff&Bakker (1998))
  - Ruhlen (1987): 27 families including 9 isolates and Pidgin&Creoles
  - Rijkhoff et al. (1993, 1998) depart from the graphich tree structure of a language family to measure the diversity value (DV) of a language family.
  - Dryer 1989: large linguistic areas
  - Dryer 1992:
    - does not look at individual languages; his basic unit is the **genus**, that is, a group of languages which can be roughly compared to a subfamily of the Indo-European family; 
    - 252 genera devided among the 6 large linguistic areas
    -  The languages within a genus are assumed to share a relatively large number of typological properties.
    - random vs. opportunistic strategies

**Song 2001 17-41**: approaches to language sampling (book)

> Bakke (2011:13): "an extensive and critical discussion of the problems with language sampling and the proposals which have been made to counter them, and pays separate attention to the issue of sample size"

20: convenience / opportunity sample (Bell 1978:128)

> shortcoming:  did not provide much insight into the nature of human language
>
> But it also gave impetus to subsequent large-scale research

**Dixon 2012:257-263 vol.1**(bib book)

263: against the name of "convenience sample"

> describe making use of every available good-quality grammar in a typological study. This is not a sample at all, and the label is misbegotten.

**Cysouw 2005:554-559**

555:

> convenience sample: no *a priori* restriction on which languages might or should be included

> **genus** for “genetic groups roughly comparable to the subfamilies of Indo-European, like Germanic and Romance” 
>
>  **stock** will be used for the maximal reconstructable unit, i. e. the highest node in a genealogical tree 

559:

- Plank&Schellinger (1997): 

  > Their attractive approach to investigate the possibilities of human language is to construct a heavily biased convenience sample consisting only of counterexample to Greenberg's universals.
  >
  > This approach to sampling -- collecting examples of cross-linguistically rare phenomena -- is also used by Cysouw (forthcoming a, b, c) ...
