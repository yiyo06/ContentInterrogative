### Reason/Advantages of PT

--------



#### **Hölzl 2018:79** 

- **gap of surveying interrogative / reason to use PT**

> [...] **the frequency of certain interrogatives across languages** that could converge to a certain degree, but this has not been investigated and turned out to be impossible to investigate for NEA due to lack of sufficient data for almost all languages.

406:

> most descriptions are extremely vague about the exact meaning of interrogatives [so that no much can be said about the semantic scope of interrogatives in NEA].



#### **Diessel 2003: 647 (?)**

647: (**Reason for using context?**)

>In order to activate the piece of information that is requested by the speaker, the hearer needs some information to find the proper element in his/her knowledge store. This information is provided by two sources: 1) the **discourse context** (including the propositional content of the question), and 2) the semantic feature of the interrogative, which indicates the ontological status of the referent.



#### **Wälchli 2009**

120: **Reason for using PT**

> Linguistic structure cannot be accessed directly, it can be investigated only in particular utterances and so linguistic typology is always a typology of texts. 
>
> PT allows for a strict definition of typological domains by extension (translation equivalents of a certain number of particular clauses in a text which instantiate a semantic domain) rather than by intension (abstract semantic definition of a domain). In particular, domains should always consist of several places in order to minimize accidental bias. The extensional domains in PT studies are thus internally complex and allow for an investigation of the internal consistency of a chosen domain.



#### **Dahl 2007 (from Cysouw&Wälchli 2007:5)**

> Massively parallel texts, when available and when applicable, can be a much cheaper method (both money- and laborwise) to reach fine grained typologies



#### **Stolz et al. 2017:27**: 

- using *Le Petit Prince* as reference text

> Since the content of the questions remains largely unaltered across the various versions of the text, they constitute a very reliable basis for the purpose of comparing huge numbers of languages



#### **Wälchli 2018:152** 

- "**doculect**" as term for language varieties

> To the extent we have translations of texts across many different languages (MPT), we can investigate the similarity of meanings on the level of exemplars.
>
> Actually, languages are too abstract units to be used in practice. All we have is specific varieties of languages, in which particular texts are written, for which the use of the term **doculect** has become common parctice.



#### **Bohnemeyer&Tucker 2013 in Auer et al. (eds.)** 

637:

> Semantic typology is the crosslinguistic study of semantic categorization -- the study of uniformity and variation in how given contents are represented across languages.



#### **Dahl 2016**:434-435

>  The crucial criterion for a **bottom-up typological investigation** is that it builds on comparable crosslinguistic datasets based on primary linguistic data. e.g. parallel text

> expressions with the same meaning, and more broadly, with the same functions, will have similar distributions in language usage. Working with parallel texts or questionnaires, data points will be locations in those where a linguistic item or feature can be either used or not used.

> at that point, I know only that these markers cluster in grammatical space without any idea of the principles that govern their use
>
> by studying the **contexts** in which they appear, i can form hypotheses about those principles, and in the end, obtain an adequate account of the crosslinguistic type i have found



#### **Dahl&Wälchli 2016:328-332**

> extension/distribution of "gram":  in a text or in a corpus a gram has a set of occurrences
>
> The advantage of using **parallel texts** is that this allows us to define grams extensionally and hence to establish gram types and prototypical uses of gram types without having to start with **a priori intensional definitions** (intension: a number of types of uses/senses/functions)



#### de Swart&Tellings&Wälchli 2022

- 6: **two main advantages of a parallel corpus**
  - provide **meaing in context**; if we have a large enough dataset, the similarities between datapoints give rist to patterns of languages use that we can relate to grammar
  - do not need to define the meaning independently of the language under consideration
- potential problem of **translation biases**, such as source language interference
- using a parallel text corpus, we explore the encoding of "not...until" across languages by means of sampling datapoints that instantiate this domain. This is basically an **onomasiological approach** (from meaning to form).
- finding markers that typically express the domain is a **semasiological step** (from form to meaning), which will introduce bias to one or several particular languages.

- 5: **Biases/Disadvantages of data from MPT**

> - written language and standardized registers；
>   - but this lect is also a general theory of linguistic structure
> - inference from the source language

 **Benefits**

> - exemplars are all contextually situated, it is possible to investigate the influence of context on the structure of the language
> - By using multiple text passages that are expected to show identical structure, it is possible to investigate language-internal variation
> - By investigating the details of variation between languages it is possible to obtain much more fine-grained typologies

  - 475:
    - to measure how much languages differ in their morphesemantic patterns (their pairings of form and meaning)
    - morphosemantic distance: the distribution of meaning across word froms in what are assumed to be translationally equivalent text segments
    - basic rationale: forms with most similar distributions across parallel texts also have simialr meanings.
  - 476:
    - the degree of overlap in distributions of the most similar forms in a language pair is a measure of the functional simialrity of forms.
    - ***important in  preamble of Diss!***
      - "differene in meanings as addressed here can only be considered in concrete texts; that is, in performance rather than competence"
      - a text in a language is not necessarily representative of a language as a whole; actually, we can address languages in linguistics only in the form of **doculects** (attested language material that can be referred to)

  - 331:

    - "a dataset of 190 **contexutally-embedded situations** from a MPT"
    - **contextually-embedded situations**: concrete instantiations of particular functions which are determined by given contexts.
    - PT allow for a direct cross-linguistic comparison of contextually embedded examples without previous abstraction of language-particular systems and without previous classification of semantic contexts.
    - at the cost of idiomaticity due to translation
    - the pactical implementation of the abstract idea of translational equivalence

  - 333: 

    - the basic entities to be displayed on the (exemplar-based) map are contextually-embedded situations in a concrete text from real translations
    - One may object that the situations will not be identical if the translation is not accurate and that translation always implies over- or underdetermination to a certain extent. 
    - Following this line of argument, the semantics of translational equivalents is hardly ever identical, strictly speaking, but only very similar. 
    - This has the practical consequence for semantic maps that the entities identified cross-linguistically should at least be more similar in meaning than the entities compared.
    - In PT situations are neatly determined by their textual embeddedness which makes it possible to include semantically more closely related situations among the analytical primitives to be compared.

  - 335:

    - The analytical primitives are chosed such that they do not imply a commitment to a particular choice of abstract semantic domains. Rather **semantic domains emerge in the map as clusters from exemplar situations if they are supported by the data**

    - Unlike implicational maps which are claimed to display universal configurations (Haspelmath 2003:213), automatically built semantic maps from exemplar data are statistical.

    - PT allow cross-linguistic comparison on the level of contextually-embedded situations, and they are more easily available.

      (*the rest part of section 2 see "methodology"*)

  - 342 table 1:

    - **analytical primitives: coding means in utterances in aligned parallel corpora**
    - distance matrix: for any pair of situations the number of differences in languages is divided by the total number of languages where both values are attested
    - Sampling of analytic primitives: The 190 situations used here have been chosen from a larger set of 360 motion event clauses in Mark so that there are a large number of overtly expressed local phrases in order to **avoid many non-attested cells in the database**. 
    - It is important to note that the dataset is **biased toward certain domains** as every typological dataset is.

  - 344:

    - The semantic roles are not represented with equal frequency, but rather with the frequency they happen to occure with in the particular text
    - when working with parallel texts, choice is restricted. Only situations which happen to be represented in the text can be chosen.
    - delimitation of the set of forms considered
    - identity of forms

  - 365:

    - **Contextually-embedded situations** have the advantage that they tend to be sharper [analytical primitives] and so it is possible to have a larger number of pixels and thus to obtain a better resolution [in semantic maps].
  - **Functional equivalence** means, in practice, translational equivalence.
    - PT are very useful at least from a methodological point of view since they embody the ideal of translation equivalence in practice with all practical complications following from that.

### **Prallel Corpora**

----



#### **Aijmer 2008 in Lüdeling 2008:275** 

- parallel and comparable corpora

  - Rosetta stone in Egypt in 196 B.C.: 2 languages using 3 scripts

  - 276 -- **multilingual corpora**: parallel corpus and comparable corpus

  - 276 -- **parallel corpus**: a source text and its translation into one or more languages; uni-/bidirectional; very often aligned, either by sentence or by word

  - 276 -- **comparable corpus**: does not contain translations but consists of texts from different languages which are similar or comparable with regard to a number of parameters such as text types, formality, subject-matter, time span

  - 277 -- early multilingual corpus: Pedant Corpus, the Oslo Multilingual Corpus

  - 277-278 -- **dis/advantages of Comparable corpus**: 

    - easier to assemble since one can use already existing corpora; necessary when one wants to compare varieties that are seldom or never translated; used especially for contrastive analysis of languages for special purposes
    - dis: difficult to guarantee the comparability; less clear picture of the correspondences of a lexical item or construction

  - 278-279 -- **dis/advantages of Parallel corpus**: 

    - native speakers' intuitions of translators; "a collection of informants' judgments about the meaning of the linguistic forms in the source texts."; unrivalled when it comes to discovering translation correspondences and displaying them as a set or a paradigm; establish contrastive lexical-semantic fields
    - dis: small size and the restriction to genres; the decisions made by the translators need not be trustworthy because translations are affected by the translation task and reflect the translators' personal style; special "interlanguage" properties as the effect of the translation process such as simplification or explicitation or "translationese" -- reflections of the source language in the target language/unequal value of words between languages; summaries from Ebeling

  - 283: 

    > the corpus is bidirectional [...] possible to test wether the similarities and differences between the languages are genuine or due to translation process.

  - 284:

    > The parallel corpus makes it possible to measure to what degree a certain translation is 'successful' or 'natural'.
