#### Definition of Question & Interrogative

----

- **Stolz et al. 2017:1**

  > Content interrogatives trigger answers which provide new lexical information, i.e. they cannot be answered by (the translation equivalents of) *yes* or *no*.
  
- **Schachter 1985**:34 (in Shopen 1985) / Schachter&Shopen 2007:31 in Shopen (ed)(2007)

  (https://glossary.sil.org/term/interrogative-pro-form; article in Bib!)

>  An **interrogative pro-form** is a pro-form that is used in questions to stand for the item questioned.
>
> The set of inter. pro-forms often cuts across other parts-of-speech classes. Thus in English there are inter. pronouns, inter. adverbs, and inter. articles (which). 
>
> And some other languages have inter. pro-forms with no English counterparts. In Tagalog, the inter. root *ano* 'what' occurs in various formations with adjective-forming and verb-forming affixes. 



- **Sadock&Zwicky 1985**:, 183-  (in Shopen 1985)

  156

> **Minor types of sentences** -- "suggestion" e.g. 'why spend your money on such trash?' 'why not resigh?' 'how about?'



*(use the same words as information interrogatives, but they are not actually seeking information from the addressee. Should they excluded from the data?)*



160:

> The interrogative elicits a verbal response from the addressee. It is used principally to gain information.



178-180

> *subtypes of interrogatives*: yes-no, alternative, information, biased (*=tag?*), rhetorical, 
>
> <u>Alternative questions</u> provide a link with information questions (*Luo 2013:9 has the similar opinion*)
>
> very nearly universal inter. form is the **information** or **question-word** question. Here the alternatives are specified not in an exhaustive way by listing, but in an open-ended way by quantification



183-186:

> **Equational sentence**: "who the-one-who-comes?"
>
> A few languages might lack information questions entirely, using instead indefinite statement or indefinite yes-no questions (e.g. Hopi).
>
> QW:
>
> - Ultan(1969:53): in terms of QW, the contrast between personal and impersonal is always present.
>
> - Some types of QW: pronominal, pro-adverbial, pro-verbs, pronumerals.
>
> - theoretically possible for a language to get by with a single morpheme for information questions, [...], so that all or nearly all information questions would involve periphrasis. [...] the smallest system of such morphemes known to us is the Yokuts systems, with three interrogatives stems, while systems of a dozen or more forms are not uncommon.
>
> As they interrogate part of a proposition, information questions always present the rest of the proposition as old or presupposed information. [...] The new information is the request for the identity of the interrogated part of the sentence. The interrogated part of the sentence can thus be called the '**focus**' of the sentence, but it is also what the sentence is about, so the term '**topic**' is used as well. 
>
> Interrogative proforms are often found in focus or topic position.
>
> Semantically, information questions are like alternative questions in specifying a range in which the answer is to be found. QWs indicate either all by themselves, or with the help of syntactic features of the question in which they occur, which part of the proposition the asker is interested in knowing about. That is, they help to determine whether it is the S, O, V, or some other element of the proposition that the addressee is requested to supply so as to yield a true proposition. But QWs also typically <u>limit the field that the asker expects the unknown to be part of.</u> 
>
> The most common functions of [...]**Dependent interrogatives** are as complements of verbs of asking, saying, and knowing.

- **Crystal 2008**

  252: 

  > **interrogative**: a term used in the grammatical classification of **sentence types**, and usually seen in contrast to declarative. It refers to verb forms or sentence/clause types typically used in the expression of questions, e.g. the inverted order, or the use of an interrogative word (or simply "interrogative"), often subclassified as interrogative adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns.

  400:

  > **question**: a term used in the classification of **sentence functions**, typically to elicit information or a response, and defined sometimes on grammatical and sometimes on semantic or sociolinguistic grounds. Syntactically, in English, a question is a sentence with invesion of the subject and first verb in the verb phrase (yes-no question), commencing with a QW (wh-question), or ending with a question tag. Some would include the use of sentences with a rising intonation to be a class of question. Semantically, questions express a desire for more information, usually requesting a reply from the listener (exceptions include rhetorical questions). The term is usually contrasted with three other major sentence functions: statement, command and exclamation. In grammatical dicussion, **questions are usually referred to as interrogative in form**. Sentences which contain a subordinate clause which is interrogative in form are sometimes called indirected question (or embedded questions).

  440:

  > **sluicing**: a term sometimes used in syntax for a type of ellipsis, in which an interrogative item is interpreted as a complete question, the omitted material being retrieved from the previous discourse. The deletion leaves a wh-phrase, *sombody is leaving, guess who*.
  >
  > **sprouting**: the existential quantifier *some* is the antecedent as in *He ate. I don't know what*.

  - 520-521:

  > **wh-**: it is used generally in linguistic with reference to wh-complements, wh-movement, wh-questions and relative clauses (wh-relatives). A **wh-question** is a term used in the grammatical subclassificaiton of question types to refer to a question beginning with a QW.

  > A **multiple wh-question** comtains more than one wh-phrase. These 'particular' or 'question word' questions are contrasted with yes-no questions. The term is commonly used in the context of generative grammar. 
  >
  > A **wh-NP** is a NP introduced by a wh-word (which car). wh-movement (wh-fronting or wh-preposing) is used to refer to a tranformational rule which moves a wh-phrase (wh-XP) to initial position in the sentence.

- **König&Siemund 2007**

  291:

  > These 'interrogative sentences' are conventionally associate with the speech act of requesting informtion.
  >
  > 'Constituent interrogatives' [...], also known by the name 'information questions', receive answers that provides the kind of information specified by the inter. word contained in it [...]. Semantically, constituent questions can be analysed as open propositions with inter. words signalling the relevant variable positions.

  

- **Huddelston 1994**:

  411:

  - Interrogative: a category of clause
  - Questions: a category of meaning; prototypically used to inquiry

  413:

  > Whereas interrogative clause type is to be defined in terms of syntactic form, the distinctive property of a question is that it defines a set of answers. 

  419: **open & closed (syntactic) interrogatives**

  According to the characteristic of the expected answer, questions using interrogative words  can be syntactically categorized to the "open" interrogative, in constrast to the "closed" class which comprises polar and alternative questions. (*semantically three kinds of question: polar, alternative, variable*) Here involves a discussion of syntactic characteristics of content interrogatives. (*details see 419-420*)

  416:

  For Huddelston 1994, the criteria to distinguish different types of questions lies on the corresponding answers that they respectively inquire/demand. That is to say, interrogative strategies needed or prescribed by grammars for establishing content interrogatives are not obligatory to determine wether a QUESTION is present, instead, it is essential that the **question meaning** is formulated, even with paraphrase. An interesting example is given by Huddelston (1994:418), which can illustrate that the syntactic form of a content question is not as strict as we usually assume: 

  ​	"[I'm marrying her] whatever you feel about her."

  In this sentence, no typical "question word" is used, neither exists a representative interrogative clause. However, according to Huddelston (1994:418), this example can be interpreted by separating it into two parts:

  ​	1) What do you feel about her?

  ​	2) It doesn't matter, I'm marrying her.

  or:

  ​	1) I'm marrying her.

  ​	2) "What do you feel about her?" doesn't matter.

  After the decomposition of the sentence, the question meaning is extracted 

  One example of the same cases from my corpus is 44012018 (or 52003009)

  425-431: 

  **discrepancies between interrogatives and questions**

  >- Interrogative is a clausal category, whereas question is not: prototypically a question is expressed by means of a clause, but it does not have to be. (A question expressed by two interrogative clauses -- disjunctive coordination, conjunctive coordination and parentheticals (*parentheticals 'how long is it, would you say / how long would you say it is?' are found in bible!*)
  >- Echo questions: the echo question indicators can combine freely with the clause type markers, so  that the echo question has no effect upon the syntactic clause type --  is question but not or just co-incidentally interrogatives; Prosodically marked non-echo question /= interrogatives
  >- (Syntactic) interrogatives lost its (semantic) question meaning 'how do you do?'
  >- definite NPs as embedded questions 'he wouldn't tell me <u>the time</u>' -- 'concealed questions' is a semantic matter
  >
  >

  434:

  > Information questions vs. Directive questions
  >
  > I: seek information; answer is statement; concerns with predictions to what will happen
  >
  > D: seek direction/instruction/advice; 'deliberative question'; answer is directives; concerns with the choice between future actions by the speaker
  >
  > The contrast between these two kinds is independent of that between polar, alternative and variable.

  > Interrogative phrase: phrase which (potentially) is moved by the wh fronting rule; syntactic
  >
  > questioned element: the variable element that is replaced by a value in an answer; semantic
  >
  > mismatch on syntactic and semantic levels!
  >
  > For example: 
  >
  > whose son -- 'whose' is Q-element, 'whose son' is interrogative phrase
  >
  > PP 'since what' -- whole obligatory as interrogative phrase, but 'what are you closing the windows for?' only 'what'; 'under what circumstances/in what way' -- the Q-element is the whole PP

- **Velupillai 2012:357-358**

  >Content questions contain an **interrogative phrase** and demand a specific answer containing other information than just a confirmation or nonconfirmation.

  **18-20:** **types of questions not requesting info in terms of their aims** (pragmatic view)

  22-23:

  > Interrogatives are semantically specialised not for descriptive bur for interpretive use.
  >
  > Interrogative utterances are used to represent desirable thoughts.

  24:

  > The speaker of a wh-question expresses an incomplete logical form, and indicates that she would regard some completion of it, or an utterance expressing such a completion, as relevant if true.

  27:

  > Interrogative sentences [...] are also linked to representation of desirability, in this case desirability of a thought rather than a state of affairs.
  >
  > Many languages have two types of interrogative sentences: those with an indicative verb, which expect an indicative answer, and those with a subjunctive verb, which expect a subjunctive answer.

- **Diessel 2003** "**the relationship between demonstratives and interrogatives**" (see also in QW section)

  635:

  > (Demonstratives and interrogative) cross-cut the boundaries of several word classes and encode the same semantic features: person, thing, place, direction, manner, time and amount. 

  636:

  > Interrogatives are QW, which instruct the hearer to search for a specific piece of information in his or her knowledge store.

  646:

  > The semantic similarities between demonstratives and interrogatives are motivated by similar pragmatic functions. Both types of expressions are directives. They focus the hearer's attention on entities that previously were not activated. This explains why demonstratives and interrogatives carry stress accent.

  647: (**Reason for using context?**)

  >In order to activate the piece of information that is requested by the speaker, the hearer needs some information to find the proper element in his/her knowledge store. This information is provided by two sources: 1) the discourse context (including the propositional content of the question), and 2) the semantic feature of the interrogative, which indicates the ontological status of the referent.
  >
  >Both demonstratives and interrogatives initiate a search for information that is guided by their semantic features. [...] They encode a small number of ontological categories that indicate the type of referent and thereby restrict the search domain.

- **Schulze 2007** "Communication or memory mismatch?: Towards a cognitive typology of questions"

  > A polar question addresses the giveness of a complex world stimulus (or utterance, if the stimulus is a linguistic one), whereas a constituent question reacts upon the question of ''givenness' with respect to a specific part of  the world stimulus.

- **Schulze 2007**

  256-257: polar / constituent / definiteness/specification

  > [In the latter case,] polar questions differ from constituent questions only in that they identify the potential conceptual domain (often stressed by intonational patterns), whereas wh-terms renders it indefinite. In fact, polar questions do not constitute a class of question constructions different form the set of constituent questions, but merely a semantically more transparent way of construing questions. **(*in corpus, some verse use polar question instead of constituent questions in some languages -- reflects the (in)definiteness of the inquired item?*)**
  >
  > Constituent questions differ form polar questions with respect to the degree of lexical and conceptual specification of a constituent.

  258:

  > Constituent questions are marked for a presupposition that is related to the givenness of a questioned referent or reference-relation cluster. (*givenness "实体相对于听者的新旧情况"*)
  >
  > This presupposition conditions that the wh-domain can be subcategorized to the extent that a languages system allow, for instance English 'who/what' or Tabasaran fuž (who:SG), fužur (who:PL) [...]. The same holds for the relational marking of wh-terms, e.g. case, or for class/gender subcategorization.
  >
  > The fach that wh-terms can be subcategorized suggested that they have bleached referential properties.

- **Bhat 2004** (from Hölzl 2018:56)

  248-249:

  > There are two other meanings that need to be expressed in constituent questions, namely (i) a request for information (interrogation) and (ii) restriction of that request to a particular constituent (namely the indefinite pronoun)

- **Dixon 2012** (from Hölzl 2018:59)

  > Content questions are better defined as questions that have a narrow sentence focus on a schematic subpart of the "proposition" and thus inquire about very specific information instead of a confirmation.

  question -- speech act   vs.  interrogative -- grammatical category

#### strategies of content interrogatives 

----

What kinds of devices do languages apply to derive content interrogatives?

Defin

(*Sadock&Zwicky 1985 in Shopen 1985, König&Siemund 2007 in Shopen 2007; Siemund 2001; Velupillai 2012:358; Mus 2015:51*)

- **Sadock&Zwicky 1985:183**

  > [information questions] are formed with the use of inter. proforms and occur either  in conjunction with, or independently of, the formal makers of interrogativity in yes-no questions. Inversion and special morphology seem frequently to co-occur with inter. words, but particles and intonation do so only rarely.

- **König&Siemund 2007** in **Shopen 2007**

  281:

  > the set of **expressive devices** used in the languages of the word for the differentiation of basic types includes all those that are generally considered to be part of grammatical systems: intonation, inflection (more specifically the addition or omission of inflectional affixes), word order, and the addition, omission, or substitution of constituents. (*explanation for **strategies**?*)

  294-296:

> **Interrogative particles** also occur in constituent interrogatives, but mostly optionally so.
>
> For Russian, Turkish and Ute, but also Latin and Finnish, the relevant Inter. particles [...] should be categorized as affixes or at least clitics, because in these languages they are not construed with the entire sentence, but are always attached to a particular constituent.

 299:

> With the exception of interrogative tags and disjunctive-negative structures, all the strategies -- **intonational marking, interrogative particle, change in the order of constituents, verbal inflection** -- can also be found with content inter. However, their occurrence is less wide-spread and their use, in many cases, optional.

300-301: inter. particles in content inter.

> the distribution of inter. particles (*refers to position*) in content inter. is clearly governed by certain constraints, but so far it hat not been possible to identify them.

- **Hengeveld et al. 2012**:47 "no basic QW in Warí"

  >A special construction type is used in which a gap indicates which constituent is being questioned.

- **Arkadiev&Caponigro 2020** "strategy without using QW in Abaza"

  18: use headless relative clauses instead of wh-words or wh- interrogative clauses to convey direct and indirect content questions.

  12-13:

  > (independent forms for 'what' and 'who') but turn out to belong to the same class of expressions as the genuine interrogative verbal form. [...] prefer to gloss them as just predicates.
  >
  > completely lacks any independent word that can be taken as counterparts to or just translated as 'where/when/how'.

- **Schulze 2007**

  248-249: strategies to encode question (not just content questions!)

  >formal: articulated substance
  >
  >structural/constructional: structural variation
  >
  >suprasegmental aspects
  >
  >emergent factors

- **Hölzl 2018**

  68:

  > Content question marking has not been investigated very often. Many languages have morphosyntactically unmarked content questions, but these may exhibit special intonation patterns that often are not clearly specified in the available descriptions.

  70:

  > While different marking strategies for questions are well-known, it is usually not recognized that these differ in their semantic scope over different questions types.

- **Moskovsky&Libert 2016**

  12:Note 11

  > The only exception [of questions involving a wh-word in all natural language] we are aware of is **Hopi** in which there are no QW, and questions resemble indefinite statements like *Someone came?*
  
- **Aikhenvald 2015:236-237**

  - Ewe has one of the most economical systems of interrogatives:
  - placing a particle *ka* at the end of a NP: 'person *ka*'  - 'who'. 'thing *ka*' - 'what'

#### QW

- **Yopán 2010**:545: a definitIon of QW

> The piece of missing information that the speaker is asking for is coded by [one of these] interrogative pronouns



- **Stolz et al. 2017**:

  9: mono- and multi-word construction

  >  it is more promising linguistically to adopt a **construction-based approach** to spatial interrogatives in lieu of a mono-word approach which is bound to cut off an important element of the paradigm. 
  >
  > 10:
  >
  > [spatial interrogatives] can be taken account of adequately only if **function is given precedence over form** and the paradigm is given precedence over the (syntactic) word.

  19-20: 

  three kinds of **paradigmatic relationship** between QW (although in this study exclusively between spatial interrogatives and other categories)

  - on the morphological level [...] share a **common stem** (at least diachronically) -- Finnish
  - the connection [...] is **purely functional** since there is **no shared stem** synchronically
  - There are also instances [...] which are **syncretic** with other interrogatives which do not have [the same functions] -- Danish *hvor*

  21: recurrent research questions with regard to the **constructional complexity**:

  - whether or not certain form-function mismatches (= syncretism, suppletion, overabundance, periphrasis, etc.) of spatial interrogatives are attested independent of genetic and areal factors,

  - whether or not there are marked differences in the complexity of the constructions employed for the spatial interrogatives – and whether or not zero- marking associates particularly often with one of the three spatial relations

>
> **how many**: quantifier

>
> QW for propositions have so far not been attested.

- **Moskovsky&Libert 2016**:12-13

  - **who/what**: nominal in nature and usually target NP argument if the verb; most typical
  - **where/when/how etc**: adverbial, performing a wide range of adverbial functions (locative, temporal, manner, purpose); in most, if not all, human languages
  - **how many**: wh-numeral
  - **wh-verb**
  - In some rare cases, QW are formed by **attaching a suffix to the nominal** targeted by the question; example of Rotuman (Austronesian) 'Hanue-s' ('-s' is a Q-suffix) from **Ultan 1978:229**
  - The QW can sometimes also be **part of a wh-NP** (e.g., an attributive modifier of the head noun)
    - Russian: kakim nozhom (which-INSTR knife)
  
  - A QW can occur as part of a **prepositional phrase** (or even a larger structural unit); German 'mit welchem'
  
- **den Dikken 2003**:84:four types of question words (from Mus 2015:)

  - regular question words
  - echo-question wrods
  - indefinite wh-words
  - relative wh-words

  Only the first type of question word serves in a question seeking information, the other three types just share the same form but have different syntactic function

  81: Examples of 'wat' in Dutch

  > But regardless of whether it is semantically interpreted as a QW or as an indefinite pronoun, its morphological composition is invariant.

- **Diessel 2003**

  637

  > eng: 'what' can be both a pronoun and determiner; however, 'who' is only used as an inter. pronoun and 'which' can only function as a determiner.

  >
  > There is significant cross-linguistic variation in the marking of demonstratives and interrogatives functioning as pronouns and determiners.

  >
  >**signal complexity** -- phonological level
  >
  >**cognitive complexity** -- content level (brought from the above three)

  In my study, the system complexity and item complexity are considered, whereas signal complexity is relatively neglected.

- **Schulze 2007**

  249-250:

  > Lexical items do not represent conceptual entities as such, but always have the value of utterances that represent -- in their most basic form -- a relationally attributed deictic construction.
  >
  > Hence, a QW 'who' does not represent a semantic concept of 'whoness', but an entrenched strategy to deictically refer to a cognitive state of uncertainty, coupled with an hypothesis about agentivity, subjecthood etc.
  >
  > From a more linguistic point of view, 'who' represents an expression of uncertainty regarding the referential value that is attributed to the relational case 'subjective' or 'agentive'.
  >
  > [...]The meaning-construction of question terms or of morphological means to encode questions depends on the construction-based semantics of interrogativity.

- **Hölzl 2018**

  77:

255:

- **Huddlestion 1994**:438 (not sure wether suitable)

> 'what did you do?' and 'what happened': the syntactic interrogative phrase is simple 'what', the semantic Q-element, however, is the VP, the predicate, in the former example and the whole clause in the latter.

20:

> HAPPEN and DO are categories which rarely occur as basic epistememes. Basic forms which do encode HAPPEN and DO are likely to encode other epistemological categories as well.

> The basic need for [epistememes] is for contexts when knowledge is lacking; when the speaker is unable to be specific or refer to anything in particular, since to use an epistememe is the least specific a speaker can be and still make a semantic categorization.



#### Syntactic role of QW (not necessary)

----

- **Chung 2020:489- :** introduce the usage of QW with the emphasis of their syntactic role

- **Tsai 2008**

​	86-87:

> English constructs wh-phrases within the morphological component: a Q-operator and a choice function variable combine to form a morphological unit (Reinhart 1998) [...]
>
> Japanese constructs wh-phrases within syntax, at the DP level.
>
> Chinese constructs wh-phrases within syntax at the sentential level.

#### Semantic categories

----

- **Hölzl 2018** "semantic scope"

  80-84:

  > There is a difference in semantic scope goes along with a larger number of interrogatives and vice versa.
  >
  > The determination of the **semantic scope** of a given interrogative presupposes a fixed set of **semantic categories**.

  The "semantic scope" used in Hölzl (2018) seems to emphasize the semantic categories which can be formulated by a certain interrogative component or its derivations.  

  84:

  > Within the conceptual space for locative interrogatives, languages differ with respect to scope, markedness, whether they have case marking or special forms, and whether case markers are also found on N or not.

  406-7:

  ! Notice the difference and the relation between the **semantic scope of interrogatives** and cases of **polysemous forms**.

  409:

  same example of the semantic scope in the category PLACE, QUANTITY

- **Karttunen 1977**: "syntax and semantic of interrogative" (not useful!)

- **Mushin 1995**"knowledge categories"

  3:

  > 'Type of knowledge' refers to the categorization of knowledge we can talk about; it is a linguistic categorization.
  >
  > An epistememe used in a situation of not knowing indicating that knowledge is lacking as well as the type of knowledge lacked
  >
  > epistemological component: categorization of knowledge
  >
  > ignorative component: lack of knowledge -- *suffixes or other component which can be added to a interrogative stem has no ignorative component since they can be applied to other parts of speech and has a grammatical function beside the semantic function to encode the epistemological category.*

  7:

  > THING, PLACE and PERSON [...] in some sense more primary. The basic epistememes of these cateogires are the ones most often used to derive other categories, either as complex epistemems or epistemic constructions.

- **Diessel 2003:640-643**"semantic features marked by demonstratives and interrogatives"

  > person, thing, place, direction, time, manner, amount.
  >
  > Jackendoff(1983) "primitives of conceptual structure"

  641:

  > (in contrast to Asheninka), all languages (included in samples) have several QW: almost all languages employ interrogatives marked for PERSON, THING and PLACE, most languages have in addition two other QW marked for TIME and MANNER, and some languages use particular QW marked for DIRECTION and AMOUNT (though the two latter are often expressed by combining a locational or manner interrogative with an adposition or adverb, cf. eng. 'how much')

  643:

  > Interrogatives are almost always marked for humanness.
  >
  >  Interrogatives sometimes encode the features CAUSE, SIZE, TYPE, and DEGREE, and they frequently express a pragmatic feature that one might call '**selective reference**' -- indicates that the hearer has to choose the referent from a contextually determined set; 'which'
  >
  > Interrogative (usually) do not carry a deictic distance feature.
  >
  > Summary semantic features marked by demonstrative and interrogatives: differ in humanness, selective reference, deictic contrast; similar in person, thing, place, direction, time, manner, amount.

  1134: gradual increase in cognitive complexity of categories

  >1) The distinction between **{x} (individual) an {l, t, m, q, r}** corresponds roughly to the familiar distinction between concrete and abstract entities.
  >
  >Abstract entities are generally taken to be more cognitively complex than concrete ones [...] in linguistic terms, abstract entities such as locations and times are most often invoked as attributes (of concrete entities and of events), while concrete entities are invoked as the logically prior objects to which those attributes are attributed.
  >
  >2) **{l, t} differ from {m, q, r}** in being "framing entities" in the sense of Zaefferer (2005:4), i.e. "neither fully concrete (local space lacks temporal location ,temporal space lacks localization) nor entirely abstract (they are not beyond both time and space)"; Within the set of concrete-abstract framing entities **{l, t}**, the latter is generally taken to be more abstract since it cannot apply to concrete individuals.
  >
  >3) within the subset **{m, q, r},** all of which are used primarily as attributes, (m) may be regarded as more concrete than (r) in quite directly ascribing a quality to a perceptible event, which (r) indicates the result of a more complex cognitive process, the inference of a causal relationship between higher-order entities.

##### Thing interrogative 'what'

----

- **Mushin 1995:7-8**

> THING: concrete things, abstract concepts, query the identity of a name
>
> ! Should be noted whether a case marking plays a purely syntactic role in the process of constructing  interrogative and thus no new knowledge category is formed.

12:

> The epistememe of THING is the most formally versatile [...] in Australian languages.
>
> always found as a basic epistememe but is used as the foundation to derive other epistememes and epistemological categories either bu regular morphological processes to form categories such as REASON, CAUSE, PERSON, HAPPEN, and sometimes MANNER, or as the root for TIME or QUANTITY complex epistememes.

- **Englert 2010** "questions in Dutch"

8:

> 'Wat': **object** questions (e.g. name), **event** questions ("what are you going to do?"), **repair** ("what didd you say?" context is important!)



*PERSON, SPACE, TIME, CAUSE etc. are often acquired by **epistemic/interrogative phrase**, which is consisted of 'what' plus a corresponding general noun, for example 'what person'. However, the reversed case is quite rarely attested in languages, that is, the semantic category THING is asked by the combination of a basic interrogative term and an other general noun. Can we find such a case in languages? Is this rarity a cross-linguistic phenomenon? If so, can we conclude that, compared to other semantic category, THING is a more 'basic' category?*

*A typology of interrogative phrase? Which basic interrogative is most frequent used to construe IP? What are the rest component of the IP? is there a limitation of the length of IP? Is the combination of the components (basic interrogative + other) fixed or is it rather flexible? Is it the only way to ask for a certain category? How are those components with each other morphologically linked?*

##### Person interrogative 'who'

- **Mushin 1995**

18:

> applies to human beings (occasionally higher animates, like dogs) and possibly extensions of human beings, like spirits or ghosts.

> **Epistemic phrase**: e.g. PERSON 'who' = 'what' + general N 'person'

##### Spatial interrogative 'where/where to/where from'

-----

- **Stolz et al. 2017** (also uses parallel text!)

  1:

  > Spatial interrogatives are morphosyntactic constructions which serve the purpose of inquiring
  >  a) about the **location** of an entity in space, i.e. the spatial relation of **Place** is involved, (**static location**)
  >

  >
  >

  >  a. **WHITHER** = the movement directed away from a given deictic center to a place other than the deictic center (cf. English *Where are you going*?),
  >  b. **WHENCE** = the movement directed towards a given deictic center from a place other than the deictic center (English *Where are you coming from*?).

  4:

  >
  > 8-9:
  >
  > > **multi-word constructions** have to be taken account of too since they are functionally in **a paradigmatic relation** with their mono-word partners. (e.g. *where...from/to*)

  >
  > 13: 
  >
  > three major patterns of syncretism
  >
  > -  all three of the spatial relations are distinguished formally, i.e. syncretism does not apply 
  > -  Place and Goal are expressed by identical constructions whereas Source has a morphosyntactically distinct construction
  > -  no formal distinctions is made at all, i.e. Place-Goal-Source syncretism

  ​	Goal-Source syncretism is declared impossible for reasons of theory (Lestrade 2010: 93, Pantcheva 2011: 226)

  ​	**Lestrade (2010:92:93)**: 'semantically motivated analysis of directionality'

  Goal and Source imply Place [...]. Place and Goal are similar in that they do not express a negative change, Place and Source are the same in that they do not express a positive change. Goal and Source are only the same if we completely neglect a change in configu- ration. That is, they can only be encoded by the same marker if Place is encoded by the same marker too.

  

  21: 

  - categories of general location: *AT/ TO/FROM* (Comrie&Smith 1977)
  - spatial relations of Place, Goal and Source -- basic categories of the parameter directionality (Lestrade 2010:77-92)
  - covers Path and Place of other approaches (Pantcheva 2010:1047)

  

  29: hypothesis from corpus data

  a) **Source** is the most marked member of the triplet of spatial categories,
   b) its **morpho-syntactic expression** is derived from the least marked member of the same paradigm, and
   c) **Place** and **Goal** are attractors of each other such that they share a common morpho-syntactic expression.

  

  34:

  **Defectiveness**: the presence of an unfilled cell in the paradigm of sth as in {A, B, Ø} -- never affects the paradigm of spatial interrogatives

  

  **uninflectability**:  

  - spatial interrogatives tend to be **uninflectable**, i.e. they are normally insensitive to grammatical categories such as gender, number, and (most probably) possession.
  - The paradigm of spatial interrogatives itself is based on **distinctions of case** insofar as three spatial relations can be distinguished formally.

  

  [for spatial interrogative] concentrate on [mismatches] **syncretism, suppletion, overabundance, (anti-)periphrasis, fused exponence** (*more theory in separate document*)

> LOCATION appears to have a tendency to be the unmarked member of the group and often serves as a basis for derivations.
>
> Many languages in NEA distinguish the three different categories (LOCATION, DIRECTION, SOURCE) 

- **Mushin 1995**

13:

> As it can pattern with locative phrases, an epistememe of PLACE often takes locative case marking (usually allative and ablative) for directionality.
>
> [when the locative form of the epistememe is unmarked,] this implies that the epistememe of PLACE is inherently locative, not inherently directional.
>
> [In other languages,] the meaning of the unmarked epistememe of PLACE depends on the verb (stasis or motion) *e.g. Mandarin*

14:

> A common property of the PLACE is its use as an 'epistemic determiner' -- when used as a nominal modifier, it picks out set membership -- eng. 'which'
>
> I call category IDENTITY. (*NOTE! different from my 'IDENTITY', equal to my 'SELECTION'*)
>
> In several languages in corpus, PLACE and IDENTITY are only distinguished by their grammatical environment.

    - then morphological composition of S and G paths are expressed -- S paths tend to be more complex than G paths such that the former morphologically contain the latter

*Is Selection a "more basic" category, since it is used to produce QW for other categories (considering the form of QW), or is it a "less independent/autonomous" category, because it often encode other categories at the same time and it is tricky to define what the existence of "selection" is (considering the performance in utterance)?*

''**wh-word**'': 

only refers to interrogative system of languages with regular paradigm, for example, English *wh-* (Huddleston 1994:417), German *w-*, Danish *hv-*. However, the tag *wh-* only stands for the recurrent orthographical feature of question elements in English, even in the other two mentioned languages, which are genealogically related to English, this tag is not representable. Even within the english interrogative words, wh-tag neglects the existence of 'how'. Not to mention for the most languages, no regular pattern of interrogative words is found. 

To apply 'wh-word' as a universal term also ignores the fact that languages, which own a set of regular interrogative words, mostly belong to the Indo-European family and are related to each other, whereas the other language families do not have such phenomena. It will not be appropriate to utilize this notion for this study which aims at avoiding the pre-set languages criterion as much as possible.  

- Stolz et al.  2017:9

> [The above approaches] are form-oriented in the sense that they focus exclusively on mono-word constructions - variously called question words or interrogative words.

''**Interrogative pronoun**'': 

In many grammars, the term interrogative pronoun are widely used for the section of content interrogatives. Indeed, the most remarkable and used interrogatives are 'who' and 'what', which are syntactically defined as pronouns. But beside them, other word classes occur almost the same usual: 'where' and 'how' as interrogative adverbs. But how about the question word 'which' in the following three usage?

​	'Which is your car?' -- NP

​	'Which car is yours?' -- Determiner / Adj

​	'Which kind of information do you want to acquire?'

(the last example is different from 'what kind of information' in that the it is assumed the choices are already known or limited.)

As can see, it is hard to definite an exclusive word class for 'which' in English. Schachter (1985:34) defines the 'which' as an interrogative article; some other linguistics name it as an interrogative adjective. The reason of different classes assigned for 'which' is not that any linguistics has given a wrong definition, but rather this question word bears multiple functions. Hence, word class is not appropriate for elucidating interrogative elements.

Nevertheless, consider diverse language-particular definitions towards word classes in language of the world, it might be not a wise decision to designate a notion in a way that may cause misunderstanding or difficulty for a cross-linguistic comparison.  

''**Interrogative/question word**'': 

really a word? What is a *word*? 

In lots of languages, interrogative is expressed by a specific affix or enclitic, is unable to occur independently.

Considering the emerging of a content interrogative, some strategies, such as final intonation or interrogative particle, which although not typical in this case, build a whole complete content interrogative with the 'question word' together. These elements seem to have little influence on the semantic meaning of interrogative (in some languages, these strategies do distinguish subtly from another in terms of semantic meaning *<u>oder auch pragmatisch?</u>*), however, the 'interrogative' in pragmatic sense cannot come into existence when they are absent. Those kinds of elements are not completely excluded in my study -- if they are written orthographically together or undividably with the 'question word' or perform a semantic difference in the sense of interrogative according to grammars (more details about this are given in Anmerkung). Therefore, the notion "interrogative/question word" doesn't exhaustively depict the research object of this thesis.

**"Interrogative pro-form"** 

parallel to <u>"interrogative determiner"</u> which 'which, what, whose' belong to; That means, "interrogative pro-form" does not include all kinds of words used to ask questions either.

In articles with focus on language typology or dictionaries for linguistic (*not sure such statement adequate or not!*), "pro-form" is frequent used and "interrogative pro-form" usually discussed  as a subsection of it. 

According to Bußmann (1980:612; *need a latest version!*), 'pro-form' refers to languages elements that have the function to substitute for other items. An analogous definition is given by Crystal (2008:390). However, both linguistics also claim that this notion prominently involves (*another word?*) pronouns which are used to substitute for nouns or nouns phrases. Although the other types of phrases, such as adjective phrases and Pro-verb, are subsumed under 'pro-forms' as well, people may tend to associate 'pro-noun' at the first place with this conception. 

> Auch: pronominale Kopie, Substituens, Verweisform. Sprachliche Elemente, die sich vor allem auf nominale Bezugselemente beziehen. Sie üben Vertreterfunktion aus, indem sie rückverweisend (Anapher) oder vorausweisend (Katapher) Vor- oder Nacherwähntes aufgreifen. Je nach kategorialer Füllung repräsentieren sie unterschiedliche Aspekte ihres Bezugselementes: Person, Numerus, Genus und Kasus werden mit unterschiedlicher Vollständigkeit von pronominalen Elementen ausgedrückt [...]

With the similar idea, Schachter (1985:24) defines the concept 'pro-form' as "a cover term for several closed classes of words which, under certain circumstances, are used as substitutes for words belonging to open classes, or for larger constituents". His definition for 'pro-form' emphasizes the its feature as 'closed classes of words'.

Compared to the above discussed terms, "interrogative pro-form" jumps out of the limitation of 'word' and is able to encompass more diverse type of interrogative realisation/occurrences. However, the "pro-" can be sometimes understood by some linguistics or in some certain languages, such as Bussmann, as the abbreviation of "pronominal" (in German) or "pronoun", whose function is mainly to substitute noun or noun phrase. Another  

**"Interrogative phrase":**

Velupillai (2012:357-358) defines that content questions comprise an "interrogative phrase". The function of interrogative phrase is to substitute as welle as to indicate the inquired information. The form of an interrogative phrase can be a single word, i.e. the most common wh-word,  or a multiword-construction -- e.g. the set collocation "how many" or a combination of a wh-word and another constituent "which clock". 

Compared to other notions, "interrogative phrase" contains a wider range of forms. Due to the similar terminological formulation, "interrogative phrase" can be easily related to other grammatical concepts, e.g. NP "nominal phrase" or PP "prepositional phrase", which refer to a syntactic construction with a head and other elements performing the same grammatical function as the head. However, the targeted items of this study might include other components, which cannot be exclusively counted for expressing interrogative in a strict sense. An instance is Korean, where the honorific suffixes are also taken into account in order to maintain the authenticity of contexts as well as to explore the potential interaction between these suffixes and the interrogative contexts. Another extreme case is Eskimo: almost every interrogative phrase contains component for grammatical or semantic meanings other than interrogative or inquiry. In terms of this, "interrogative phrase" is not a perfect notion for this study either.  

**A suitable/neutral term for this study**: 

Compared to the above rivals, 'pro-form' is the one that is the most apt  to be adopted in this study. Yet, I still want to find a formulation which can be the most thorough but meanwhile general to describe the research object, namely the expression or the form for content interrogatives, and maximally prevents any preconceived notion. It means to avoid any terms indicating a certain kind of characteristic, a specific word class and a debatable form in languages. In this sense, I prefer the expression "**Content interrogative element /unit**". (*not finished!*) Especially for a cross-linguistic empirical study -- on one hand, more language-particular cases can be covered under this notion -- here I mean all possible forms described above and also a vast amount of unmentioned instances; on the other hand, it avoids the terminological asymmetry / non-equivalent among languages

Update (24.11.21): maybe **interrogative form** will be a better term, since element can be ambiguously understood as the constituents included by an interrogative 'word'.  

Update (27.02.22): inspired by Murphy (2010)'s introduction to the lexical meaning/semantics, where she uses the term in P. 10 *lexical unit* to refer to a usage of a word in a sentence -- "a particular instantiation (i.e. instance of use) of that lexeme". maybe **interrogative unit** can  be applied to denote the occurenace of an interrogative context. This term may particularly refers to the interrogative utterances happending in natural texts/contexts as opposite to the "interrogative words" prescribed in grammars.

Updata (07.03.22): use **interrogative primitive** to refer to the basic form of interrogative unit. The paradigms listed in the descriptive grammars belong to the realm of this term.

Whereas, *content* is equivalent to *information* is this sense. Although not a synonym of these two words, I will also use *question* as alternation, since it stands for the function and goal of such a speech act.

#### Anmerkung

--------

- (from Luo 2013:12)   In some languages, it is reported that **final rising intonation** is a part in content questions as well as in polar questions. However, this device will not be discussed/considered in this thesis, since the focus of this study lies in the semantic aspect of content question constructions. Terminal intonation plays a role as a signal for content questions, which does not provide notable semantic information in terms of interrogative. To enable a comparison between all interrogative components and provide consistent forms for the computational program, the intonation symbols are excluded in the morphological analysis under the circumstance that the semantic meaning of content interrogatives is not changed. More details about this process will be given in the following method section.  

  (from König&Siemund 2007:281-282) Besides, König&Siemund (2007:281-282) considers the **intonation** as exceptional since 

  > it is never in paradigmatic contrast with another strategy.
  >
  > Any intonation contour, or at least most of them, can apparently superimposed on any segmental structure [...] It is for these reasons that we hesitate to regard intonation as the most important strategy for the identification of sentence types and [...] hesitate to identify a formal sentence type in a language purely in terms of intonation.   

  **Hoymann (2010:2727-2728)**  also avoids intonation in her analysis towards interrogatives in ǂĀkhoe Haiǀǀom, since it is not exclusive to express interrogativity -- information in terms of syntax, semantic, discourse, pragmatic etc. can be encoded in intonation as well. She also claims the difficulty to find a "pure" question intonation as well as to record the intonation perfectly during a natural conversation considering the audio limitation.

  Indeed, there are cases that intonation plays an indispensable/compulsory role for identification of  the sentence type. König&Siemund 2007:282 (footnote 7.) gives an example for German polite imperative: Without the final falling intonation, the sentence will be perceived as an interrogative. However, even in this case the intonation always co-operates with other strategies and will not alone establish an interrogative sentence. Under the "parallel text" precondition in this study, i.e. it is assured that the contextual environment is an interrogative, the role/existence of intonation can be therefore neglected.  

  Although in the data analysis, intonation will not be included, it does not change the decision of my above discussed choice about terminology, since the omission of the intonation from an interrogative element only serves the purposes to conduct a computational comparison. The absence of the intonation has no impact on the semantic meaning of interrogative element.

- (Luo 2013:13) **Interrogative/Question particles** can occur in content questions as well, e.g. in Mandarin, but in contrast to polar interrogatives, they are mostly not obligatory for content interrogatives (König&Siemung 2007:294). However, as Luo (2013:13) pointed out, as their functions in content questions are primarily to indicate the interrogative speech act as well as to convey different pragmatic meanings, they are not indispensable components for a content interrogative construction. Furthermore, the final question particles normally does not locate directly next to question words/phrases, for example in standard Chinese, which builds a "loose" construction and is easy to be separated. Similar to terminal intonation discussed above, this kind of final question particle is not considered in the comparison. 

  However, with regard to the distribution, not all question particles locate in the terminal position in a question sentence. There are languages in which the question particles occur as affixes of question stems (*then is not a particle but an enclitic? should be formulated as 'written together with the question words'?*) and even go through (*another better word?*) sound change with respect to the phonological environment. Languages owning this type of interrogative particles, as indicated by König&Siemund (2007:295), are for example Turkish (*mi*), Latin (*ne*), Ute (*aa*) and Finnish (*ko/kö*). They suggest that such kind of interrogative particle should be seen as affixes or clitic on account of their attachment to the sentence constituents.

  For these interrogative particles placed immediately with/after interrogative elements/stems, their operating scope is not sure the whole discourse as the other which locate in the terminal position, but can only be the constituent that they are adjacent to. Again, these kind of interrogative particles may practice no influence on semantic meaning of interrogative elements, they are still taken into consideration of the analysis. (*not sure useable!*)

  Beside the pragmatic and signal purposes, they may also express subtle semantic differences in terms of interrogatives. In this condition, the question particles are included in the following comparison. 

- (König&Siemund 2007:283-284) **Asymmetry** between form and illocutionary function, e.g **rhetoric question** -- an interrogative sentence expresses a statement.

  > The basic sentence types have a certain functional potential or default interpretation.
  >
  > "inference theory": [these sentences] are indeed used as [...] questions, but in addition to having this illocutionary force they also have the force of [...] a statement [...]. This secondary function indirectly expressed -- hence the term 'indirect speech acts'  -- and based on conversational interaction which ultimately trigger such inferences. Such inferences rely heavily on contextual factors.[...] In other words, such hints could simply be overlooked.

- For the choice/delimitation of the research items / elements, it is important to maintain the consistency within each language, as the PAM first takes the differences of question elements from each contexts in a language and coverts them to a relative value named "distance". For each language, PAM generates distances between contexts. These distances represent the degree of dissimilarity between contexts. Then, the program compares the distances of all languages and thus conduct a cross-linguistic comparison.

- **Echo questions** ? Form vs. Function

  - König&Siemung 2007:318-319

    > - Purpose: to seek clarification on a preceding utterance
    > - echoing sth. previously uttered in the form of a question often precludes the use of the standard inter. constructions and necessitates a more indirect way of asking questions.

    

  - Huddleston 1994:1, 426-428

    > Mismatches between interrogatives and questions are found in the areas of [...] echoes [...].
    >
    > *see 'interrogative' above!*

  

  **Delimitation of research objects "content interrogative"**

- An expression using wh-words can have different interpretations except the ordinary interrogative reading. For example, the speaker may actually convey a rhetorical question or negative attitude. In some languages, other linguistic devices in the sentence assist in distinguishing various interpretations, such as Cantonese, sentence final particles and prosodic play a great role in the reading (see Choi 2021 presentation). However, there are plenty of languages in which the various readings of questions look exactly the same in form. Contextual cues are the mean in those language to distinguish readings of questions. In this study, I don't want to at first place draw a rigorous line between the "real" content and rhetoric questions (which are constructed in the form of information questions, and exclude the latter). One reason is that the limited amount of useful data that the corpus can provide. The other is that both categories apply the same strategies to establish interrogatives. If the surrounding verses, i.e. "context", are not taken into consideration and we only focus on the verse where the expression with wh-word locates, it is not easy to tell that it is not a formal content question but rather a rhetoric question. Least but not last, sometimes it is tricky to decide wether the speaker asks only in order to express a statement rhetorically but not to inquiry information. It will an misfortune to rush to delete such instances from the data without giving them a chance to go through the analysis / the further discussion. Therefore, for the data collection and the first-step analysis both types -- real content questions and "suspect" content question --  are included. The uncertain cases will be further discussed in the second part of result.

- Beside the difficulty to distinguish 'real' content question and rhetoric question which are identical in form, the boundary between content question and the other two types of questions -- polar and alternative -- is also rather vague during the data collection and the analysis. The examples are given respectively below:

- **Interface between content & polar AND content & alternative **: 

  - content & polar:

     "Who among you ....?" vs. "Is anyone among you ...?"

     - **Hoymann 2010** (shared marking for both types of questions) 

     - **Sadock 2010**

       2:

       > quite commonly there is no sentence type in a language that lumps together both polar and content questions into a single, overarching category.
       >
       > These two kinds of questions are frequently not marked by a common formal feature.
       >
       > polar has some distinctive interrogative intonation whereas content shares the intonation of declarative sentences.
       >
       > For the other Germanic languages (beside English), the case for conflating polar and content questions is even weaker.

       3:

       > There are [...] some languages in which these two central classes of interrogatives are bound together by some grammatical marker. In Eskimo there is special interrogative verb inflection.
       >
       > In Japanese the sentence-final marker ka- is found (optionally) with both types of question.
       >
       > In Hindi QW occur in situ in WH-questions. Polar questions can be marked with the initial QW kjaa, otherwise meaning 'what'. [...] Hindi might be said to have an interrogative sentence type marked by a QW in both information and (some) polar questions. (*Indonesian the same case and can be explained in this way?*)

  - content & alternative:

    "Which is easier: A or B?" vs. "Is A or B easier?"

    **Hölzl 2018**

    93:

    > One pattern recurring in many languages is a combination of a content question followed by a polar, focus, or alternative question that elaborates on the frame set by the content question.

    95:

    > these combinations of questions follow a natural and dynamic path of *metal process* that unfolds through time, from the schematic to the specific.

    In my data, there exists such examples: "What is heavier, A or B?" In fact it is a alternative question which is set in the frame of a content question.

  - 21: recurrent research questions with regard to the constructional complexity:
    - whether or not certain form-function mismatches (= syncretism, suppletion, overabundance, periphrasis, etc.) of spatial interrogatives are attested independent of genetic and areal factors,
    - b)  whether or not there are marked differences in the complexity of the constructions employed for the spatial interrogatives – and whether or not zero- marking associates particularly often with one of the three spatial relations
  - 22: within the framework of functional typology
  - 22: adopted theories
    - construction grammar -- for measuring the complexity of constructions (Fischer & Stefanowitsch 2006)
    - word-based model -- morphological constructions (Haspelmath & Sims 2010:46-53)
    - natural morphology (Dressler et al.. 1987) -- interpret markedness
  - 635:
    - The discussion of the paradigm of spatial interrogatives of more thatn 400 languages world-wide reveals that there are no fundametal differences which would make it necessary to assume two different sentence type-dependent grammars of space in general, i.e. interrogative vs. declarative clauses
    - [However,] the paradigms of spatial categories are not automatically structured identically across the sentence-types in individual languages
      - *hypothesis: a cross-linguistical tendency of the correspondant paradigms between declarative and interrogative clause?* 
        - *if the number of Person/Thing is marked in declaratives, e.g. singularity, duality and plurality, the interrogative is corresponingly marked? -- but it is rare that a language coins an unique form to mark number of missing information* 
        - if the above hypothese cannot be attested, it may give a rise to another hypothese that the parallelism between the grammar of declaratives and interrogatives is not verified cross-categorically. That is, whearas Stolz et al. (2017) proves the correspondence between paradigms of different sentence-types in terms of spatial relations, other categories, e.g. Person, may own two sets of grammars respectively in two sentence types.

    - Zusammenhang mit dem Kontext oder der Konsituation is häufig bei der Einteilung der Fragen betrachtet.(hier meinte der Autor die "syntaktische" Umgebung)
  
  - 466-7:
  
    - **expressive Funktion**:  
      - emotinell-gefärbte vs. emotionell-neutral Fragen
      - die appellative (impressive) Funktion liegt der Einteilung der Fragen zugrunde, in: eigentlich (echte), rhetorische, deliberative, konsutative, simulative, fordernde, kontradiktorische usw.
    - **semantische Funktion**:
      - **Ergänzungsfragen** vs. **Entscheidungsfragen**
      - Unter Ergänzungsfragen kann man solche Fragetyepen aussondern, die eine Unbekantte oder mehrere Unbekannte enthalten.
    - Bezug auf den (syntaktischen) Kontext
      - **Initiating Question / Initialfragen**, die den Dialog anfangen: "wo wohnst du?"
      - **Sequential Question / Nachfragen/Sequenzfragen**
        - **Vergewisserungsfragen**, die auf die vorhergehende Aussage hinweisen, indem sie eine Wiederholung oder Bestätigung ihrer Voraussetzung velangen: "ich wohne in Berlin - Wo?"
        - **Rückfragen**, die eine Bestätigung der vorhergesagten Fragen erwarten: "Wo wohnst du? - WO ich wohne?"
          - die entwickelnden Aussagen: "Wollen wir ins Kino gehen? - Wann?"
          - Gegenfragen: "Bist du zufrieden? - Und du?"

    - Zu den **Frageexponente** in indoeuropäischen Sprachen gehören: interrogative Intonation, partikeln, Wortfolge und Pronomina und Adverbial
    - In den anderen Sprachen kann auch: **interrogative Modus** (eine gewisse Verbform der Entscheidungsfragen): Eskimo
    - In den meisten indoeuropäischen Sprachen dienen zur Kennzeichnung der **Fragen Parikeln** neben Frageintonation und QW
      - balto-slavische, indo-iranische, keltische, armenische, Albanische, balkanische, Serbokratische, Makedonische, Bulgarisch, Neugriechische
    - Mit dem Schwund der Fragepartikel wächst die Rolle der **Intonation**: Tschechisch
    - **interrogative Wortfolge**: romanische, germanisch
  
  - 470: QW
  
    - QW können die Unbekannte des Fragen repräsentieren
    - ander als Fragepartikeln: haben lexikalische Bedeutung, übernehmen in der Aussage verschiedene Funktionen von syntaktischen Satzgliedern.
    - **!** kein eins-zu-eins-Korrelationen zwichen QW und ihre kontextäquivalenten Nominal:
      - Nicht alle morphologischen Kategorien von Nomina werden durch die QW konnotiert, z.B. dual Person bei QW
      - Nicht alle morphologischen Kategorien von QW finden ihre Entsprechung bei den Nennwörtern, z.B. eng. 'whom' = deu. 'wem' oder 'wen'?
      - ***Reson for terminology & research purpose!***
  
  - 471-472: 13 Fragentypen gebildet von Fragenexponenten, 8 davon hadelt sich um QW und QW mit anderen
  
    - Wenn QW mit Intonation zusammen auftrittm, dann behandelt es eine Ergäzungsfragen uzw. Sequenzfragen, wiederholte oder emotionell-gefärbte Fragen.
    - QW kann außerdem auch mit Partikel und Wortfolge zusammen vorkommen, was Ergänzungsfragen uzw. Initialfragen, neutral, und zum erstenmal gestellte Fragen bildet.
  
  - 472:
  
    - Über die Bedeutung der Ergänzungsfragen entscheidet ausschließlich das QW. -- Singal des Fragen
  
  - 474-475: **Zeigfunktion der QW (semantic classification)**
  
    - Gegenstände:
      - personell
      - impersonell, belebt
      - impersonell, unbelebt
    - Possessivität - belebte Gegenstände
    - Quantität - vereinzelt, Kompaktplural, Pluraliatantum, Reihenfolge
    - Designation - von beiden, von mehreren
    - Qualität - Langform des Adj., alternative
    - Räumlichkeiten - perlativ, ablativ, adlativ, lokativ, delimitativ
    - Temporalität - delimitativ, bestimmend (Zeit)
    - Kausalität - Grund, Ursache
