  - 344: 
    - delimitation of the set of forms considered
      - there are no neat cut-off points even if we avoid the notoriously non-applicable distinction between adposition and case
      - *there are no clear cut-off points to define what is the "real" interrogative part.*

    - Identity of forms
      - complex local phrase markers are separated by equals signs (=), which allows the program that calculates the distance matrix to calculate several matrices making different choices

    - the problem [of full automatically building of semantic map with the help of automatic alignment] is automatic morpheme analysis or algorithmic morphology which has not yet reaches a stage where it can be recommended for semantic map approaches.
    - footnote 8: distinguishing simple from complex forms is not strictly possible. complex forms gradually merge in grammaticalization, and there are numerous instances in the database where one can discuss whether equals signs should be added or omitted. 

- **Stolz et al. 2017:52**

  > "the formal complexity of words can be measured in terms of the morphological units into which the word can be decomposed"

- **Haspelmath&Sims 2010**: concepts and knowledge about morphology

  - Definitions of ***base**, **root**, **stem** (base of an inflected word)*
  - 

- **Haspelmath 2012:123 Note 9**: 

  - ***root*** can simply be equate with ***morph***

    "In the present context, *root* can simply be equated with *morph* ('smallest meaningful piece of form'), because linguists will normally call morphs which refer to things, actions or properties *roots* (rather than *affixes*). [...] In a cross-linguistic context, it seems best to define roots as 'morphs that denote things, actions or properties'.)"

- **Booij 2015** 'Morphological Analysis' in **Heine&Narrog (eds.) 2015**: 

  - "**morpheme**" is not the start point of morphological analysis as well as morphological structure

  508:

  > "The **system paradigmatic relationship** between words may also be signaled by other means than morpheme concatenation, such as stem alternation, reduplication, stress, and tone patterns. Therefore, the notion '**morpheme**' is a useful analytic notion for the description of the internal structure of words, but not the starting point of morphological analysis and morphological structure."

  509:

  > - **cumulative exponence**: "there is no one-to-one mapping between morphemes and units of (grammatical) meaning"; 
  > - [this kind of morpheme] is called a **portmanteau morpheme**.
  > - Grammatical features that are expressed by the same morpheme are separated by a dot instead of a hyphen [in glossing].
  > - **stem**: the form minus its inflectional markers
  > - **root**: the stem minus its word formation morphemes.
  > - Example: word/form -- *workers*, stem -- *worker*, root -- *work*

- **Bybee&Beckner 2015** in Heine&Harrog (eds) 2015: **Usage-based theory**

  836-838:

  - **Gradience**: boundaries of many categories of grammar are difficult to distinguish, usually because change occurs over time in a gradual way, moving an element along a **continuum** from one category to another.
  - example: **cranberry morpho**, the degree of grammaticalization

  

- **mackenzie 2009:1140**

  - "instances which are diachronically complex but synchronically simplex" "**morphosyntactic relatedness**" 

  

- **mackenzie 2009:1150**: 

  - possible Limitation "**<u>paradigmatic levelling</u>**" (see Interrogative-semantic scope); 
  - counts "only the simple forms as true interrogative forms" (from Hölzl 2018:77)

  

- **Hengeveld et al. (2012:46)**: only include "basic question words"

  

- different from what **Dixon 2012:383** done to examples in (10), where he did not do the decomposition for the forms which cannot be counted as "**<u>meaningful morphemic elements</u>**". The same view of Dixon is shared by **Heine et al. 1991:58**, where he distinguishes "**<u>monomorphemic forms</u>**" from "**<u>submorphemic elements</u>**" and the latter is excluded from his analysis, since "they are not productive parts of the morphological inventory of the languages [...]", even though they have formal relation with existing morphemes. His example is the recurrent inital element *w-* for all interrogative words in German.

  

- **Aronoff 1976:10, Hölzl 2018:77**, also mentioned above in **Bybee&Beckner 2015** about "gradience"

  - Problem of **<u>cranberry morphs</u>**

  

- **Waugh&Newfield 2011:202** against 'morpheme' as the only element to represent form-meaning relation

  ***see document "Isomorphism"!***

  - from the perspective of iconicity and isomorphic principle, there are other kinds of word-affinity relations
  - *actually validate my decision not to segment QW only on the basis of **morpheme*** 
  - *a better concept: **distinctive unit** instead of "morpheme"?*



### My words in dissertation

-----



- The reason why I process data in the opposite of the two above linguistics is that, the goal of this study is to discover the shared interrogative elements among contexts by trying to mirror their formal similarity as much as possible. The "authentic" interrogative words/phrases provided in grammars are not the only target of my research. Although the productivity of these "submorphemic elements" do not exist and their function is not given in grammars either, their existence in the interrogatives may be a kind of formal representation of some convert properties of semantic categories. Therefore, I will include them in the morphological analysis. 

- These instances will be segmented as much as possible in my study, in order to explore the potential connection between interrogative elements.
