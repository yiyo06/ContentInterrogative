#### Comparability

-----



- **Haspelmath 2019**:

  - 3-5: comparative concepts, language-particular categories & natural-kind categories)

  - 11-14: shard-core, fine-grained categories

    12: 

    > comparative concepts often refer to a shard core and are extensionally smaller compared to language-particular categories means that not all parts of every language enter  the relevant comparison [...] one need more **fine-grained comparative concepts**.

#### Isomorphism

--------

 ***(see separated document!)***



- **Haiman (1985:19) Isomorphism Hypothesis**: 

> Cross-linguistically recurrent identity of form reflects similarity in meaning. Similarity is gradable. The more often any pair of meanings are expressed by the same form in different languages, the more similar are their meanings. 

> Categorization implies that a range of similar, but different, meanings are expressed by the same form and are treated as if they were the same thing although they are slightly different meanings.
>
> In pariticular languages, meaning is always distorting by categorization. [...] The distorting effect of categorization can be reduced by means of cross-linguistic comparison.
>
> It is true that all languages categorize, but they categorize in different ways. Hence, differences in meanings that are irrelevant in one language may become apparent in another language.

- **Wälchli 2010**

  - 336:

    - categories are not identical cross-linguistically, but only similar.

      (*What we are pursuing is no the complete identity of analytical primitive, but rather the similarity to a extent as great as possible.*)

    - Schopenhauer: poineer of the semantic map method

      - used overlapping circles to illustrate the non-congruence of concepts across different languages, illustrating the difference of "spheres of meaning" of words in different languages

  - 337:

    - Similarity in meaning is accessed by way of formal identity (categories in particular languages) in a diverse of languages
    - **Weaker claim of Isomorphism Hypthesis**:
      - Given any two meanings and their corresponding forms in any particular language, the more similar the two meanings, the more likely it is that they are expressed by the same form in any language.
      - A necessary condition for cateogies is that categories have the property that they group similar rather than dissimilar exemplars together.
      - Similarity is not only required for describing the non-congruence of language-particular categories, but more genergally for modelling any relationship between meanings.
      - ***Applied to my methodology part!***



- **Waugh&Newfield 2011**
  - 202:
    - word affinity phenomena [...] are best seen as based on a network of formal and associated semantic relations
  - 203:
    - The word, then, is a gestalt (a unified whole) which gets its defining characteristics from its ties to (its associations with) other words of the same language. It is a paradigmatic unit which exists in a network of relations.



#### Similarity (semantics) / Exemplar-based

------



- **Croft 2007**

- **Wälchli 2010** (semantic map based on) exemplar-based data

  - 335: **examplar-based data**

    - The analytical primitives are chosed such that they do not imply a commitment to a particular choice of abstract semantic domains. Rather **semantic domains emerge in the map as clusters from exemplar situations if they are supported by the data**
    - Unlike implicational maps which are claimed to display universal configurations (Haspelmath 2003:213), automatically built semantic maps from exemplar data are statistical.

  - 337: **similarity semantics**

    - **similarity semantics** is a cover term for all approaches to semantics where similarity is considered to be a more basic than identity
    - Manthner 1923: similarity is the more fundamental notion than identity

  - 338: **exemplar semantics**

    - The meaning of a category can be approached in two different ways. It can be considered to denote an abstract concept, or it can be considered to be a range of individual meanings of exemplars.
    - George Berkeley

  - 339:

    - "similarity" has often been regarded as too unconstrained a notion, too flexible
    - The basic idea of similarity and exemplar semantics does not say anything more than that meaning is constituted by similarity relationships between exemplars rather than the meaning of entities and situations in isolation.
    - Mervis 1988 about psycholinguistic:
      - in talking about categorization, the type of similarity which provides the basis for category assignments must be specified

  - 364:

    - the empirical focus of the semantic map approach follows from the a priori unpredictable nature of similarity
    - Meaning emerges by way of semantic connections between exemplar situations based on similarity
    - And the semantic network arising is constrained only by the unpredictable set of similarity relationships between any pair of exemplar situations, which differ, however, strongly in the probability of occurrence.
    - Semantic space is a probability space which can be modeled by statistical methods which need concrete databases as input

#### Cross-linguistic vs. Typology

-----

- **Wälchli 2010**

  - 347:
    - a major aim in typology is to identify genreal tendencies within the whole range of cross-linguistic diversity
    - many methods of typology do this at the cost of heavy data reduction

- **Cysouw 2001**

  - 18-19:

    

#### Semasiological vs. Onomasiological

------



- **Tahmasebia&Borina&Jatowt in Tahmasebia el.al (eds.)2021:8**

Two complementary approaches to study lexicon:

**Onomasiological** approach: how particular meanings or concepts are expressed in a language.

**Semasiological** approach: takes linguistic forms – words and multiword expressions – as its point of departure and investigates which meanings they express.
