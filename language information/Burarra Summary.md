### Note

- Green 1987:72-74

> Information questions are formed by placing an inter. at the beginning of a sentence and replacing the sentence-final falling intonation with a rising intonation.

> **-nga** combines with the appropriate 3.person DAT pronoun to ask 'what for, who for, who to, who at''.

- Green 1987:8-9

> Indetermines: **yinda** 'where', **yina (=) gaya** 'which, of known possibilities', **=nga** 'an indeterminate person or thing**. Used as interrogatives, and in introducting subordinate clauses with universal reference.

> **-nga** negated by **gala** means 'noone, none'

- Green 1987:12

> **gaya** has been found only functioning as an interrogative, alone or in combination with **yina** 'where'. It thus appears tobe the inter. corresponding to the set of demonstratives, asking 'which, in/at which of a set of known possibilities? which specific place?'

- Green 1987:15-16

> adjectival class prefixes (Glasglow 'prefix-descriptives): 
> 
> **an-** -- human males, some animals, some trees, cars ans trucks, sand, fish spears and hooks, the moon, and the lighting

> **jin-** -- human females, animals not in the an class, some trees, and the sun

> **mun-** -- vegetable foods, grass, some body parts, paper, pens, clothes (but not shoes- gun class), bedding. tins, aeroplanes, guns and spears

> **gun-** -- liquids, other body parts, the ground, places and houses, shoes, plants and trees not in another class, fire and firewood (but not grassfires- mun class), wind and rain, and abstract things like thought, law, time

> the semantic categorization [...] of the mun and gun classes, is not clear

> **an** and **jin** as masculine and feminine.

> Nound class: a morphological distinction between humans and nonhumans is made, in the **an** class only, on **=nga** 'an indeterminate person or thing' [...] Class prefix system -- for **-nga** -- HUMAN: **ana-**, NONHUMAN: **an- / mun- / gun-**

### Question:

- **gala** means negative. for combination 'gala + QW', does it count? should the QW from this vers be written in the 2. column? e.g. 40012034

- not sure **-ngiya** means 'which'; 40022036, 41008027, 41012028, 42009018, 42012057, 44013025, 45014004, 59002006, 66017007

 - according to 2. source, -ngiya = -yinga
