### Note

- Weber 1989:39 / Weber 1996:431-433

> Inter. [is] followed by question markers **-taj /-taq/** or **-raj /-raq/**

> usually the questioned element occupies the initial sentence position

> the interrogative suffix can appear in the interrogative word if that word is the nucleus of the sentence, but always after the pluralizer, the nuance suffixes and the case suffixes.

> **-nö** 'similar'

- Weber 1989:325

> **Types of question of HgQ**: validation question (yes/no; **-chu**), content question, altenative question, tag question, what+do question ('what did he do to you?'), negative question, embbedded question (include: embedded content question, embedded alternative question, finite embedded question), third person question ('what does John say is good to eat?')

- Weber 1989:327-329

> Content questions marker **-taq / -raq**; occurs at the end of the questioned constituent, e.g. [also can] occur at the end of the adverbial clause containing the QW.

> **-taq** cannot occur within a questioned substantive phrase. e.g. 40015034 (*more explanation in this page*); **-taq** is used when the speaker assumes tha the addressee knows the answer to the question; **-raq** is used when he does not assume so.

> **ima-ta-taq**: 'what' + OBJ + Q

> **-lla** 'just'

- Weber 1996:434 

> given its meaning, -raj is obviously the correct suffix when there is uncertainty

- Weber 1989:330

> It is also possible to form questions where the questioned element is the verb formed by **ima** and a verbalizing suffix, e.g. **ima-ya:-chi-ma-nqa-raq?** 'what-become-cuas-=>1-3FUT-Q'

- Weber 1989:331

> Embedded content questions: QW in an object complement (with a substantivized verb) and are followed by **-pis~-si** 'indef'. (#*how to distinguish the differnt meanings of this suffix?*)

- Weber 1989:332-333

> The verb **-rika** 'see' may occur with an embedded question, the verb of which is not substantivized [...]. 

> Third person questions ask the hearer about what someone else has said. A QW occurs in a quotation expressing what the other person is alleged to have said. However, the question marker follows the instance of **ni-** 'to say' that dominates the quotation: e.g. **"pi-mi taqay" ni-n-taq noqa-paq?** 'who-dir that say-3-Q me-PUR (who does he say that I am? lit. about me, he says "taht (one) is who?)


- Weber 1996:634 suffix list

> **-chö**: in, at (locative); 

- Weber 1989:197-225

> **-man** GOAL; **-pa** PUR; **-pa** GEN; **-wan** COM; **-naw** 'similarity'/MANNER; **-naw+pa** MANNER in which sth is achieved or was done

- Weber&Zambrano&Villar&Dávila 1998:25

> 'a' which becomes 'ä' when certain suffixes are added (*maybe in text '-pa' > '-pä'?*)

- Weber&Zambrano&Villar&Dávila 1998:629-643

> ![P. 633: posttransition suffixes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33869669/112279949-c2ff1200-8c84-11eb-9d4b-51db64995b2b.png)

> **-paj**: purpose

### Question:

- 42014005	Maygayquipapis	: **-pis ~ -si** can also function in an embeddd content question, difficult to distinguish.
