- QW are in initial position

- Robinson2008:224

> **heya, anya, henan, hadia, hahe, hangan** form sentences with a structure similar to that of an equational sentence, with the interrogative acting as the predicate.

> **apay, panyan** function as auxiliary verbs and are often connected to the main verb with a linker.

> ! Content questions can also be formed **without** the use of interrogative words [...], where the sentence has the structure of a declarative, and its status as a question derives from the intonation.

> Bsp. "makin-pangal iday''

>       OWNER-arrow   MED.DEM

>       'Whose arrow is that?'

- Robinson2008:225

> The anser to a question with *heya* should involve a personal name. When the questioner is seeking an answer with a common noun, *anya* is used, even thought that common noun may refer to a person. Of the two possibilities, *anya* is the more general one, used when the speaker is unsure if the answer will be personal name or a common noun. The interrogative *heya* is occasionally used for 'what'. In its usage as' what', *heya* is interchangeable with *anya*.

- *heya* is multifunctional / homophonous: indicate the specifity of a noun as a enclitic; indicate the past times; can be shortened to *he*

- Robinson2008:226

> *anya* can be used with a pronoun to enquire about why someone didi sth. When it is used in this way, it has a similar syntactic distribution as *apay* as it is connected to the main verb with a linker.

- Robinson2008:227

> 'where' questions can be created by forming nominalized locatives from any verb. (i.e. without QW)

> Bsp. "angay-an=mo"

>       go-LV=2SG.GEN

>      'Where are you going?' (lit. 'place where you are going?')
