### Note

- Heath 1984:453-462

> Yes/no particle: **yuga / aliyung / ala**. The most common particle is **yuga**. It may precede the queried clause, may follow it (in this case often functioning as a tag question), or may occur by itselfas a one-word question when the cotent of the query is obvious in context ('well, how about it?'). **yuga** may be added to a clause already containing a WH interrogative word. 

> WH interrogatives are not alway strictly interrogative in the sense of intending to elicit a reply [...] we may interpret individual occurrences of WH words as either 'interrogative',' indefinite', or 'dubitative'. It is not suggested that these have sharp boundaries, or that it is always possible to categories individual occurences. 

> By dubitative, we mean instances where the speaker is expressing his or her own ignorance of the identity ('i don't know what/where', 'i wonder what/where'). The dubitative may verge on interrogative force, since an expression of speaker's lack of knowledge may imply a request for clarification by the addressee. 

> The status of the queried clause may be made somewhat more precise by adding a particle. **ari** 'maybe' normally points to indefinite or dubitative function [...] The dubitative reading is probably best with **ari** in most instances. 

> **yuga** plus a WH word is most often (though not exclusively) interrogative in force

> The form **yangi** with no affixes is regular for S or O of the predication. NC prefixes ae uncommon (though possible). Because in most contexts it is not certain which noun class the queried referent will turn out to be in, even the verb [...] does not usually specify the expected NC of the referent.

> **yangi** may be used with human reference when the focus is not on an individual's peson identity, but rather on clan or moiety status or the like.

> use of NC prefixes with [nonzero case forms of **yangi**] follows the pattern set by N: instrumental **-miri** usually occurs withno NC prefix, while other nonzero czse suffixes usually do take a prefix. In these inter. forms, the NC prefix is the punctual ANA class form **a-**.

> **yangi** occurs in a few idimoatic expressions roughly tranlatable s 'all kids' or 'lots of them'. One is **ngunyju a-yangi**, literally 'like what?', but having the idimatic meaning 'lots, many'.

> A similar emphatic expression involves **yangi** preceded by the stem **algur**, which elsewhere means 'kinsman'. [...] these idimatic expressions involve **yangi** as a kind of rhetorical question.

> ['who'/'whose' involving] suffix **-nyung-**, **yangi-** optinally undergoes a minor vocalic assimilation to **yangu-nyung-**

> **ngargu**: can function as an ordinary n, or as a N root requiring defivational NC prefix, or as a NAdj taking intra. pronomian lprefixes and fuctioning as predicate. 

> **lhal-ngargu**: **-lhalng-** 'flame, firelight' with the final nasa lost regularly before another. The suggestion is that time of day is associated with the position of the sun. 

> **-yaminggari**: 'to do what?'; also used to elicit approval or confirmation of a suggestion; can fucntion as an all-propose general question.

> **(w)a:ng** 'whatchamacallit?' formally a N, and is used as a filler while the speaker tries to remember a name or other N.
