### Note

- Willett1991

> CONTENT QUESTIONS: require a declaration in response, either to supply information not already known about a situation or to choose between alternative descriptions of the situation.

> YES-NO QUESTION: require only assent or dissent to hte description of a situation already given.

> RHETORICAL QUESTION: require no linguistic response.

> Phonologically, a change in intonation occurs in several question forms: declarations normally end with a drop in intonation, but some questions end with a rise in intonation. This applies to all yes-no questions and those content questions that do not contain WH-words.

> Morphologically, WH-words and three particles are used to convey speicific inter. meanings.

> There are three ways to ask a content question. 1) is by the use of WH-word to elicit specific information about a given situation, its setting, or the entities involved [...]; 

> 2) For some content quesitons the meaning of CLARIFICATION is also present. This meaning is expressed by the use of the particle **gui**; it indicates that the speaker wants to get more detail about a certain entity or setting element involved in the situation, or he wants to establish that the information he has is correct. Accordingly, this particle has two main uses in the inter. mode: in content questions and in rhetorical questions.

> 3) does not utilize either a WH-word or **gui**, but rather the INTERROGATIVE ALTERNATIVE CONJUNCTION **ca'**. THis alternative conjunction is used in questions instead of **piam** 'or' which is used only in noninterrogatives. Its presence signals that the speakers does not know which of two alternative descriptions of a situation is correct; therefore he is eliciting the opinion of the speaker. [...] THe inter. alternative conjunction **ca'** is also used with the sequestial conjunction **va'** to indicate a type of rhetorical question. Here the speaker is not entirely decided on which description of the situation he thinks is most accurate, and ponders the question to himself in the form of a rhetorical question. One further use of **ca'** is in so-called "tag questions", where it is always followed by the negative adv **cham**.

> The use of RHERORICAL QUESTION in stp is also infrequent, and most often these are short phrases, such as **jax gui mas** 'what else?' and **jax dyuy** 'no way!'.
