### Note

- Tamanji2010:154-160

> Question in Bafut divide into four major categories, some of which are capable of finer subdivisions: 1) yes-no questions, 2) content questions, 3) alternative quesitons and 4) confirmation questions.

> Content questions divide into three subcategories following their mode of formation: 1) simple content questions ('who did the police beat'), 2) passivised questions ('who is beaten by the police?') and 3) focused content questions ('who is it that the police beat?'). [...] The formation of the three types of questions is sensitive to syntactic positions (Subject, object, oblique) such that while all three modes of formation can be used to question a constituent in one syntactic position, only two are used to question constituents in other positions. 

> Simple content questions: to question subject NPs only. In their information, the QW occupies the syntactic position corresponding to the constituent about whose identity information is being requested. There is no rearrangement of the linear distributiong of words and only the QW plus a general rise in intonation mark the utterance as a questions. 

> The passivised is the most natural and common means of questioning the identity of subject NP in Bafut. [...] In their formation, a number of syntactic changes affect the basic SVO word order. First, in intra. verb strutures, the question is introduced by a focus marker **á** while the wh-word questioning the identity of the subject NP occurs in a position after the verb.

> the formation of a focus question involves the use of a focus mechanism. Focus questions in Bafur ferther divide into two ctegories depending on the type of focus mechanism employed: 1) In situ focus questions [...] ; 2) Cleft questions: the QW is transposed to the beginning of the utterance, intruduced with the cleft **à nɨ́** 'it is' which is generally contractible to simply **ǎ**. The constituent sentence from which the QW is extracted then follows the QW introduced by the complementiser **mə́**. All grammatical positions can be questioned using this method.

> Alternative questions are formed with the conjunction **kə̀** 'or' and the question particle **lɛ́** which usually comes at the end of the sentence. This is the only situation in Bafut where a morphological question paricle is used.
