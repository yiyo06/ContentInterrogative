### Note

- Aikio&Ylikoski 2010:70

> ![Declension of **mii, gii**](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33869669/102195019-52469d80-3ebe-11eb-8b6e-0c3329cc40c5.png)

> **mii** shows a unique morphosyntactic peculiarity. Its normal SG.GEN form is **man**, but when the SG form of this pronoun appears as a direct object, the form **man** is only used in the meaning 'which one', but **maid** in the meaning 'what'. Otherwise, 'what' and 'which' are not distinguished.

- Aikio&Ylikoski 2010:104-106

> **mii, gii, goabbá, guhte (~geuhtemuš)** are used as both interr. and relative pronouns

> When interr. occur as modifiers of N, they show agreement just like adnominal demonstrative do ("partial" agreement in SG, "partial" or "full" in PL).

> The pronouns **mii, gii** show a unique morphosyntactic peculiarity: when a NP with the modifier **mii, gii** occurs in SG.NOM, only the pronoun takes the SG.NOM marking, whereas the noun itself appears in the PL.GEN (even though referent of the NP is SG and not PL!).

- Aikio&Ylikoski 2010:172-176

> The inter. must be placed first in the sentence (excluding discourse particles), but no other changes in word order occur. 

> Polar yes/no question are formed by inter. clitics: the most common inter. clitic is **=go**. The clitic is attached to the head of that phrase in the sentence  which the question concerns; the phrase must occur as the first member in the sentence (excluding preceding discourse particles).

> When attached to te adverbs **olu ~ ollu** 'much' and **ghuhká** 'for a long time', the clitic **=go** forms questions of degree, e.g. **Olugo mákset biillas?** (much.go pay.PST.2SG car.LOC0) ‘How much did you pay for the car?’; **Guhkágo ođđet?** (for.a.long.time.go sleep.PST.2SG) 'how long did you sleep?'

> Another clitic **=son** may be attaced after **=go**. The clitic **=son** indicates that either the question is rhetorical, or that the speaker expects a negative answer.

> another inter. clitic **=bat** [...] adds an impression of surprise to the question; can even added to an inter. word to express the speaker's surprise.

- Kahn&Valijärvi 2017:?

> The inter. adverbs are combined with the particle **-ge** to form indefinite adverbs which are used in negative clauses, in questions, and in conditional clauses. e.g. **gosage** 'to nowhere, to anywhere', **gostege** 'from nowhere/anywhere', **goassege** 'never, ever', **moge/movtge** 'in no way, in any way', **manin** 'for no reason, for any reason'

- Kahn&Valijärvi 2017:5.6

> 'no~, any~' **interrogative pronoun + ge**

> '~ever, any~' **vaikko/feara + interrogative pronoun**

> '~ever, any~' **interrogative pronoun + fal/beare/ihkinassii/ihkenassii**

> 'some~' **interrogative pronoun + nu**
