> The nouns in Fulfulde are subdivided into twenty or more noun classes. The grouping of nouns into classes is a form of categorization. [...]

> A noun class is morphologically signalled by the form of the class marker that occurs as a suffix on most nouns. A noun class is syntactically defined by the use of the same concord as an anaphoric marker. 

> The concord is usually of the same class as the class suffix. Sometimes the class of the concord is not identical to the class of the suffix. A shift in concord class (often due to semantic reanalysis of the content of the suffix class) can be the cause of this difference. 

> sematic categories: number, size

> classes: 'O, 'BE, 'NGEL, KOY, 'DAM, KAL, NDE, NDI, NDU, BA, NGE, NGO, NGU, NGAL, NGOL, KA, KI, KO, KOL, 'DUM, 'DE, 'DI

> Most noun classes do not have a homogeneous semantic content, they have no obcious semantic feature that can serve as a label.

> The inter. forms for 'whihc/who/what' can occur on their own in a NP or as a modifier following a noun

> The inter. forms of some classes have a special meaing: they function as the following QW, possibly, but not necessarily preceded by the morpheme **hɔ- / hɛ-** marking the inter. forms. 

> hɔ- + 'O class concord : **hɔ-mɔ** 'who'

> hɔ- + 'DUM class concord: **ho-dum** 'what' 

> ma- + NDE class concore: **ma-ⁿdɛ** 'when'

> hɔ- + adv **to** 'there': **ho-to** 'where' 

> hɔ- + adv **nɔ** 'thus': **hɔ-nɔ** 'how'

> When asking for the specification of a certain noun, these inter. words follow the head noun.

> QW always have focus and are followed obligatorily by a relative verb conjugation.

- 251: question particles

> they are placed either in initial or final position of a sentence. They are used to signal yes-no question: **naa/na**; **kori**
