> a) The interogative word occurs as close as possible to the beginning of the clause; b) when the interrogative word occurs in an adjunct  (which is typically fronted according a) above), then the rest of the clasue exhibits Subject-Predicate order

- Wollams1996:227 - content question particles

> These particles are usually found immediately following the inter. word. With the exception of *pa*, they also occur in yes/no question, although not necessarily with the same meanings which they confer upon content questions. Most of them contain an extra element of affective meaning, and often change the illocutionary force of the interrogative to a rhetorical question or an exclamation. There are six such particles

>  - **pa** only after *ja* and *kuga*.

>  - **kin** when initiating a communicataive exchange with someone by means of a question. It has a midly emphatc effect upon the inter. word which it follows, meaning sth. like 'tell me'.

>  - **nge** express either the speaker's irritation or frustration with sth, or is uttered when challenging the addressee to respond

>  - **ndia** expresses the speaker's disbelief, surprise or wonderment. It often collocates with *kin / nge*.

>  - **keh** expresses the speaker's annoyance and/or criticism

>  - **kuté(ken)** expresses surprise
