### Note

- Robert2013

> Noun class system; Noun class agreement marker (10): C-:

> Noun class & SG: k- (PERSON), b-, w-, m-, g-, j-, l-, s-

> Noun class & PL: ñ- (PERSON), y-

> Adv class & SPACE: f-

> Adv class & MANNER: n-

> QW = CL- + inter. morpheme (-an / -u)

> Two parallel sets: **CL- + an** Focus; **CL- + u** Null tense

> The null tense inflexion: a subordinate mood; obligatory in most subordinate clauses

> -u questions: formally identical to indefinite relative clauses

> (-u) question words: no syntactiv autonomy; clitic pronouns, clause initial; like relative pronouns (different from -an!)

> Origin of the -u QW: grammaticalization of relative pronouns 

> Origin of the -an QW: orginating from a locative QW (see 'ana'); the dedicated inter. proforms in Wolof

> two strategies for sonstituent QW: 1) **-an** set: common in African languages; 2) **-u** set: interrogative, relative pronouns and indefiniteness

- Robert2016:2

> the two patterns of content questions are apaparently in free variation rahter than complementary distribution [...] Not all content QW are based on the noun class markers.

- 4-8

> Among the ten noun class markers, **k-** is taken to form the SG 'who?' pronoun, **ñ-** the PL one and **l-** the 'what?' pronoun, and all of them can be used for the selective inter 'which?' (adj) or 'which one?' (pronoun). The two adv. classifiers **f-** and **n-** are used respectively for 'where?' and 'how?'.

> The inter. pronoun for 'what?' uses the class marker **l_**. This class contains very few items (5% of the nominal lexicon) and covers a variety of semantic domains. [...] There is no sg/pl contrast for 'what?' which functions as as 'mass pronoun'. 

> Selective inter: by constrast with other noun modifiers, but in agreement with the general rule for QW, the inter. adj is usually fronted and precedes the head noun. However, it may also appear after the noun; this latter word order corresponds to an echo question.

> The word **nit** 'human being' show regular agreement in the **k-** when the inter. adj is postposed to the noun, whereas the more usual fronted position of the selective inter. triggers a class change for this single term: **nit** then exceptionally takes **b-** class agreement.

> the selctive inter. for (pesonal) proper name is based on an **m-** class rather than on the **k-** marker. 

- 8

> The **u-** morpheme in wh-question words constitutes a third element in the Wolof system for spatial deixis.

> these two parallel sets of inter. pronouns and pronominal adv trigger different verb inflections: the Null Tense conjugation for the -u set and one of the three focusing conjugations for the -an set. 

-10

> the unusual position of -u qw [...] and [...] the semantic affinity and formal identity between the two typesp f clauses, we many assume that the use of -u pronouns in questions proceeds from a reinterpretation of free indefinite relative clasuses as inter. clauses. This type of grammaticalization correponds to what Evan (2007) has called "insubordination".

- 11-12

> Questions with -an interrogatives thus use a referential path involving a focusing strategy: the consitituent about which info is requested from the addressee is selected for focus (and therefore foregrounded) and treated morphologically (cf. focusing conjugation) and syntactically (cf. fronting) in consequence. Note with this set of qw, the syntactic function of the inter. pronoun is indicated by the focusing verb inflexion (i.e., subject vs. complementn focusing conjugations).

> the -u and -an qw are fronted an do not remain in situ (wh-movement). However, the -an pronouns have a certain degree of syntactic freedom indication that they are independent or strong pronouns [...] The -u inter. do not have this syntactic autonomy: their position is strictly constrained to clause initial position and they cannot take modifiers. 

> 'who, what, which, where, how' < CL + -an / -u

> 'why': periphrasis < lan / lu + tax (V 'to cause')

> 'when, how much, **naka**, **ana**': specific (unanalyzable) stems 

- Franke2016:57

> Entscheidungsfragen [...] werden mit dem QW **ndax** eingeleitet. oder **mbaa**.

- Creissels et. al2008:134

> [i]n many [African] languages (particularly, but not exclusively, in the Chadic family), so-called 'qw' are not the sole markers of questions: they code an unspecified participant (a human, a thing, a place, etc).

> Torrence2005:65

- An optional wh question particle, **an-a**, occur only on the left egde: 

(an-a) lan l-a-nu togg

Q what xpl-a-3pl cook

"what did they cook?"
