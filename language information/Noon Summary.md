### Note

- Soukka1999:111

> The determiners that may occur with the noun are demonstratives, adjectives, quantifiers and interrogatives. They all occur in postnominal position, generally in this given oder. All determiners may have either determinative or pronominal functions in the NP. 

- 136

> Interrogative determiners occur in questions that requires a specification of a certain noun. As with other determiners, the nouns may be implied and the determiners then has a pronominal function, which still shows agreement with the implicit noun. [...] There are two groups of inter. determiners: selective **~iida** 'which one' and quantifying **~era** 'how many'.

- 155-156

> Unlike the inter. determiner, which may also have a pronominal function, these pronouns do not determine a noun in the NP, but occur independently, referring to a constituent of the clause. 

> The inter. pronoun is always in a post-predicative position. If the pronoun refers to an object or an adjunct, it occurs in the same position as this constituent. When referring to a subject, the place of the constituent has to be filled by a projection; a formal subject. This position is flled by an indefinite pronound (**iñii** for **ya** or **ɓii** for **ɓa**), and the inter. pronoun comes  in clause final position. 

- 216

> These two inter. adverbs (**na** and **kera**) will put the adjunct in question, and they occur in the post-verbal position of the corresponding adjunct in the clause. 

- 374

> Yes-no questions: a clause followed by the polar-question particle **-e**.

- 376-378

> The position of the QW is in situ of the element it replaces, except when replacing a subject. 

> It happens quite regularly that the question particle **-e**, which has a distinctive function in the yes-no questions, also occurs in QW questions, especially when the QW **ɓa** and **na** occur clause finally. Although both these QW have a short final vowel, the output is a long final **-ee**. The presence of this particle is never obligatory in these questions, but it seems to function as a reinforcement of the inter. nature of the clause.

- 380

> The particle **maa** [...] as a question introducer which serves to make the question more polite, to prepare the addressee for it. 

- 327 "Discourse conjunctions"

> **haa** 'what about / how about' (additive): occurs as an additive conjunction with the function of introducing another person or object in the convesation by posing a question to or about him/her/it. Quite often, it is a previous proposition that is being turned to a different person or object, most commonly to a person in the 2sg. The coujunction precedes the nound or pronoun that indicates the addressee of the question.

### Question:

### Morphological analysis
