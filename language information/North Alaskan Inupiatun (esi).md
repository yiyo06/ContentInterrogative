> **kiña** has the stem **ki** in ABS.SG and the stem **kisu-** in ABS.DU and PL, but for all other cases, it follows the inflectional a=patterns of an unpossessed N.

> For **sua** , Nagai says that inflection is like a regular unpossessed N except for the ABS SG, which hs two variants, **sua, suna**.

> Interrogatives are a closed class of words that do not refer to anything but request information. They are subdivided into 4 types: inter. pronoun 'who, what', an inter. adverb 'where', inter. particle 'how' and 'when (in the future)' and inter. verb bases 'do what' and 'do how'.

> All these inter. may function as indefinites [...] In such cases, inter. pronouns, adv and particles are often followed by an enclitic **=tai**, which emphasizes the indefinite or non-specific tone of the word to which it is attached.

> Inter. may be followed by a postbase **+payaaq** 'every' or an enclitic **=payaaq** 'every' to function as universal pronouns 'everyone, everything, everywhere'/

> There are two sets of possessive forms for 3rd person, those ending in **'-ŋa'** and those ending in **'-a'**. (qimmiŋa & qmmia; atiŋa & atqa). They seem to be mutually usable in the same context, though the -a form may be more intimate, reflexive-like. (*in text **nalli-a-nun**?*)

> Rlative possessive forms [...] read P. 17. When a possessed n is the S of an S-O verb, it has a dual ralationship, being related to its verb as well as its possessor. (e.g. **qimmi-a-ta**)

> the **-ta** suffix appears as **-sa** when following **-i**
> 
> **-n** is coupled to **-ŋa** to show the same relative possession
