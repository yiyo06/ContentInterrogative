> In wh-questions the inter. word is fronted.

> Inter. quantifiers bind entities with the following semantic features: **cine** [+animate], **ce** [-animate], **care** [+partitive, +/-animate], **cât** [quantified NPs]. **al câtelea** [ranked NPs]

> In non-standard Romanian **care** can substitue **cine**

> Inter. adverbs bind entites with the following semantic features: **unde** [+place, +point of arrival]. **când** [+time], **cum** [+manner], **cât** [+quantity], **de ce** [+reason/purpose], **încotro** [+direction]

> Inter. pronouns / adj / adv combine with a large number of pp: see expamples above with pp

> In multiple questions all the inter words, irrespective of their morphosyntatic category, can be fronted. [...] Multiple questions show a 'superiority effect', that is the wh-subject obgligatorily precedes wh-objects and wh-adjuncts.

- Dindelegan&Maiden 2013:568-569

> In wh-interrogatives, the wh-phrase is placed in initial position and the subject (when different from the wh-word or from the wh-phrase) is obgligatorily postverbal.

> Indirect, wh-interrogatives obgligatorily have the word order of direct interrogatives, while relative clasues do not display this restriction.

- Dindelegan&Maiden 2013:128-134

> one must distinguish between **PE**, direct object marker, and lexical **pe** meaning 'on'. [...] **PE** in he direct object structure shares, on the one hand, certain features with lexcial **pe**, on the other hand, it has certain specific features.

> shared features with lexical pe 'on':
 
 > both instances of pe select the ACC case
 
 > like other Romanian PP, it blocks the definite article from occurring with otherwise unmodified N, but the NP has a definite and specific reading.
 
 > it allows for a relative clause to be its complement
 
> specific features of functional PE:

 > it does not assign thematic roles
 
 > [...]
 
> The selection of PE is conditioned by the following: i) the NP occupies the direct object position; ii) the NP has the feature [+specific] iii) the head of the NP has the feature [+personal / +animate]

> it is argued that there is a forth, epistemic salience, which can justify the preferential hierarchy in PE selection

> accidental uses (! *Examples include a content question*)

> the syntactic rules distinguish between the contexts in which PE is obgligatory, optional, and excluded.

> In pronominal constructions, PE is obgligatory if the direct object is realized as: [...] the inter. pronouns **cine** 'who', **care** 'which'.

> the prnounn **cine** [...] re specialized for human referents, while **care** [...] receive the marker PE, for any type of referent ([+/-human])

> PE is optional in the following situations: for a NP denoting a person, when it associates with [...] the inter. quantifier **câți / câte** 'how many' [...]. The fact that it is 'optional' does not mean that the presence / absence of PE does not have semantic effects; the selection of PE adds specificity information.

> PE is not allowed [...] with an indefinite or negative pronoun specialized for non-animate referents: [...] **ce**, **ceea ce**.


### Question:

- 40026008	**Pentru ce** or just **ce**?

- in some verses, the pesonal pronoun is combined with the QW as a suffix with '-'. should not be seen as a part of qw, but temporarily wriiten together in the 2. column. e.g. 42006046
