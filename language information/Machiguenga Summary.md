### Note

- Cysouw 2007:28

> in Machiguenga, the interrogative **tyara** ‘where’ can be combined with the verb **-kant-** ‘to say’ to yield meaning ‘how’ or ‘why’ (Snell 1998: 259). Also in Machiguenga, the demonstrative **aka** ‘here’ (possible a loan from Spanish) can be used with the verb **-kara-** ‘to cut’ to mean ‘when’, with the verb **-kant-** ‘to say’ to mean ‘how much/many’ or with the verb **-na-** ‘to be’ to mean ‘where’ (Snell 1998: 74). The usage of the verbs **-kara-** and **-kant-** is completely parallel with their usage in Asheninca, though the interrogative basis is completely different (tsica vs. aka)

- *here **aka** is for QW construction 'aka ~', no suffix -aka!

- Snell 2011:27

> **Aka** appears with **karatagantsi** to indicate up to
where something arrives or ends, or 'when' e.g. aka onkaratake

> **Aka** appears with **kantagantsi** with the meaning of 'how many / how many', or 'of what size', e.g. aka ikantaka

> **Aka** appears with **nagantsi** with the meaning of 'how many / how many there are' and to ask 'what time it is', e.g. aka inake

- 819

> In general, it is not marked in the noun if it is animate or inanimate but the affixes **-ni / -no** animate and inanimate **-ti / -tyo** that appear with other parts of speech match the noun they refer to.

- 822

> In addition, the insistent suffix **-mpa** or the adversative suffix **-ri** is often added to a pronoun personal with the idea of emphasis, insistence or contrast; suffix **-nirika**, which also occurs with verbs of state and certain adverbs, it is used with the meaning of 'as if it were'

- Snell 2011:824

> When an interrogative pronoun appears with a negative adverb, it is used in a non-interrogative way with the idea of 'nothing, nobody, not a little'.

- 826

> Interrogative pronouns also appear with a variety of suffixes, mostly to give more emphasis or expand the meaning, e.g. **-rika** and **-mpa**

> **-ratyo** [...] indicates admiration, surprise or recognition that something is surprising, is different from the suffix combination
**-ra** subord. and the suffix **-tyo** excl. [...]

- 829

> The animate adjective **akani**, much like the inanimate form **akati**, works in an interrogative sense with the
meanings of 'how many, how many, how much, how much, how big'.

- 834 examples of verb -kant with affixes

> anakempatyo >'-an-ak-empa-tyo'
> 
> anakari > 'an-ak-a-ri'

- 835

> when the subject of a verb is inclusive first-person suffix, the plural suffix **-iga / -ig** is also included. In addition to using these forms to include the listener in the action or state to which the speaker refers, they also often use them to make universal statements of principles. e.g. **a**nea**ig**akeniri

- 840 

> [...] the plural suffix **-ig** is a participant modal
> 
> > The term “participant” refers to people or things that take part in the action of the verb or that
are affected by it

- 846

> **-ig/-aig** plural verbal

- 835 

> 'suffixes for object or complement of transitive verbs'
> 
> **-na** 1.
> 
> **-mpi** 2.
> 
> **-ri** 3. M
> 
> **-ro** 3.F
> 
> **-a** 1.inclusive
>
> It is worth mentioning that the suffix **-a** 1.incl. appears before the time suffix while the other suffixes personals appear after this; for example, compare **i-p-aig-ak-a-i** 'he gave us' with **i-p-ak-e-na** 'he gave me' where the complements are **-a** and **-na** and the time suffixes are **-i** and **-e**.

- 836

> **-ro** direct object of V
> 
> **-mpi**, **-na** indirect object of V

> **-a** the real or non-future reflexive suffix
> 
> **-empa** unreal or future reflexive suffix

- 837

>There are four suffixes used in active verbs in the Matsigenka language that indicate not only the time and real or unreal modes of action but also the reflexivity of the verb:
>
> **-i** real non-reflective
> 
> **-a** real reflective
> 
> **-e** unreal / real non-reflective
> 
> **-empa** reflective unreal patterned

> It is important to note that after the suffix **-ak** perf., **-e** only indicates the non-reflective without taking into count mode. Similarly, after the stative suffixes, the suffix **-i** only indicates the non-reflective while **-a** indicates the reflective

> In addition to the unreal suffixes already illustrated, there are prefixes with the same function that match they. The unreal prefix **n-** appears with themes beginning with the consonants ch, k, t, ts, e.g. O**n**chapinitana**e**ra (*note the combination of prefix **n-** and suffix **-e***)

- 840-841

> [...] the epenthetic segment (or thematic suffix) **-t** before **-ak** perf [...]

- 846

> **-ai** / **-i** is used when it is preferable not to mention the subject's name because it is unknown, because you do not want to disclose it or because it is not very important. (The **-i** form appears with themes or other suffixes that end in -a or -i.) This same suffix appears to appear in intransitive, reflexive, and reduplicated when the subject refers to many people or repeated actions

- 849

> **-na**: The use of this suffix indicates an action performed repeatedly, mostly in a negative context. although the action itself is not necessarily negative

- 854

> **-an** indicates movement so that a distancing takes place, an action that takes place when one is for leaving or is leaving for another part, initiation or continuation of the action, the passage of time, etc

> **-ak** The perfective aspect indicates that the action or process of the verb is seen as finished in relation to a point in particular. Non-perfective verbs express action that continues or that was not carried out or finished in the past. In Matsigenka verb constructions, the perfective aspect is indicated by the suffix -ak perfective. This suffix is the only aspect suffix that follows the directional suffixes; never appears with the other suffixes aspects described in sections 4.10.2 - 4.10.8.

> **-a** This suffix indicates repeated action. Furthermore, at the discourse level, it serves to indicate a change of scenery in a narrative or the highlight of it. e.g. gonkeig**a**empa (*-a-empa?*)

- 858-9

> in the practical spelling, when -gani follows a suffix ending in -n it is written as **-kani**
> 
> This suffix only appears in verb constructions with normally transitive themes and with prefixes of third person subject of masculine or feminine gender; preferable not to mention the name of the person doing the action because it is unknown, because you do not want to divulge it or because it is not very important. The passive suffix indicates that the subject is the recipient of the action instead of acting.
>
> The suffixes that can come before **-kani** are: [...] **-en** irreal

- 860

> **-ra** appears at the end of the verb in a clause that indicates when or where an action is performed (first example); is used in verbs that indicate the purpose of another action where an infinitive would normally be used in Spanish (second example); if one asks to repeat something that has been said, if it is a verb, -ra is increased; indicates simultaneous actions (third example); is used in place of the imperative (see 4.6.2) as a more soft to ask a favor or give instructions or an order (fourth example)

- 864

> **-rika** indefinido

- 865

> **-rorokari** [...] expresses more certainty than -rika but still leaves room for doubt

- 875

> The adverb **ario** is used both to confirm information and also to request confirmation of it

- 882

> **-nivati** sf.adj.inan. the one who still stays

- 169

> **kantagantsi {ikantakeri}**: [...] 2. hacer **¿Tyara pinkantakero
koviti?* 'what are you going to do?'

> **Kantagantsi** appears frequently with an onomatopoeic word to represent a great variety of actions, movements, sounds, sensations, emotions, etc. [...] e.g. **okantakena, ikantake**

> **ikantaka**: 1. have a certain physical characteristic, symptom, e.g. **tyara pikantaka?** 'What are your symptoms?', **tyara ikanta shiani?** 'how is the anteater?' 2. cómo, qué (indicate the despair of the subject) e.g. **Tyampa nonkantaempa nanuitaera?** 'How am I going to be able to walk again?'

- 480

> when **tata** appears with the adv.neg.irreal **tera**, or the adv.neg.real **gara** that corresponds to it, it cancels its interrogative characteristic

- 559

> **-tyo** 'excl.'; **-niroro** 'afirm.'

- 560

> when **tyara** appears with a reflexive form of **kantagantsi**, it can have one of the following meanings: 'por qué, 'cómo es' , 'qué tiene', e.g. **tyara okantaka**, **tyara ikanta**, **tyara okantagani**

> **-rorokari** to give more emphasis, still generally indicates ignorance, disbelief, lack of patience or total despair

- Snell 1998:71

> interrogative adverbs can also be used in non-interrogative sentences
The main members of this class are: **aka** when, **ario** like that, right, and those that start with **tya**

- Snell 1998:74

> **aka** appears with **karatagantsi** 'cut' to indicate how far it reaches or ends something can have the meaning of 'when', e.g. **aka onkaratake**

> **aka** appears with **nagantsi** 'to be' with the meaning of 'where', e.g. **aka inanake**

- Snell 1998:23

> **no-** 1.

> **i-** 3.M
