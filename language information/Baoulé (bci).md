> More often, however, the inter. are topicalized by being moved to the front of the question. In this case the copula **jɛ** occurs obligatorily if the inter. is other than the subject of the sentence. **jɛ** occurs optionally if the inter. is the subject. If the topicalized inter. is the object of the sentence, the 3SG person pronoun occurs after the verb.
