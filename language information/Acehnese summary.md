### Note

- Durie1985:151 -- explanation of **epistemological classifer**, in Asyik this group of words is called 'tu-words':

> [...] a closed class of Epistemological classifiers [...]. These are morphemes used in contexts where knowledge is at issue: the kowledge of something's identity, existence or attribute. They encode epistemological categories. 

> The trdaitionally termed *interrogative pronouns* or *wh- words* of English encode epistemological categories.

![Durie1985:151](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33869669/82298097-e5b10200-99b3-11ea-8f61-6f657795da52.png)

- Durie1985:152

> The most basic epistemlogical categories appear to be distinguished in all languages. Word for *who* (person), *what* (thing), *how* (manner), *whether* (existence of state or event) seem always to occur in some form. Human beings seem to prefer to divide their expression of knowing into categories that are universal. As striking as the underlying similarities are the differences that languages show in the formal expression of epistemological categories. In this respect epistemological categories are idiosyncratic to each language. This is particularly so in those categories that are not amongst the most basic ones.

> Many languages do not have separate interrogative forms for *whither* 'direction to' and *whence* 'direction from'. In modern English the locative interrogative *where* is used in conjunction with prepositions to express these categories of knowing [...] In Acehnese the epistemological classifoer for place *pat*, can be used for *whence*, but not for *whither*, for which a differenct classifier form *ho* is always used.



- Durie1985:164

> "Interrogative words are formed from epistemological classifies. Some epistemological classifiers can occur on their own as interrogatives: pue, soe, töh, pat, ho."
 
- occurs only in conjunction with **na** 'be, exist': dum / dup, dit, ubê, oh, et

- 165:

> **po** 'whose' forms an interrogative with **soe** 'who', either **soe po** or **seupo** 'whose?'

> **pa + ~**: 'pa-' can be interpreted as as allomorph of **pue** 'what' or **pat** 'where' (as in 'pa-ne')

- rare: four words compoundes

 **töh  pa    -kri -ban seuneuban'-jih**
 
 which what  how   how  manner    3
 
 "what was it like?"
 
- It can ba immediately followed by a pronominal enclitic. 

- Durie1985:262 -- Functions of inerrogative words

> - as a core role; as the functional equivalent of an incorporated NP in locative Udergoer incorporation or possessor focus; as a peripheral constituent; as a non-verbal predicate

- Asyik1987:284

> Sometimes **nyang** 'who, which' is used after the QW, just as the case with focus sentences.

- Durie1985:39-40

> In the most general sense reduplication implies something other than the usual, with the emphasis being on something more than the usual: 

> **beungeh=jih lagee=peue-peue**

   angry 3     way   what what 
   
   "He was as mad as anything."
   
- Durie 1985:66; 184

> **keuneuk** 'likely to'; **buet** 'work, deed'

- Durie 1985:174-175 **keu-**

- Durie 1985:242

> **beu=** illocutionary marker 'DES' 'I want'

- Durie 1985:271

> **beutôy** 'turly' = **beutôi** from 42016002?

- Durie 1985:41

> **-ka** 2

### Question:

#### *peu kheueh* appears frequently, is it a QW?

  - Durie1985:93: 
  
    ***peue'=keuh** adeuep =keu=kee?* 
    
    'what EMPH punishment to I?'
    
    "What is my punishment?"
    
  - 42006033			Dan meunyoe gata tapeubuet nyang jroh ateueh ureuëng-ureuëng nyang jipeubuet jroh ateueh gata mantong , *peu* jasa gata ? Ureuëng meudesya pih jiteupeu peubuet lagée nyan ! 
  
    - in 42006032 is *peue jasa gata**
  
    
#### 41011003			Dan meunyoe na ureuëng nyang tanyong bak gata peusabab gata peuleueh keuleudée nyan , gata peugah laju , ' Tuhan nyang peureulée , dan ureuëng nyan laju jijok pulang . ' "
    
  - **peusabab** is "peue + sabab (because)"?

#### 44023019			Keumandan nyan laju jimat jaroe aneuëk muda nyan , " Peukeuneuk gata peugah ubak ulôn ? "

  - not sure 'Peukeuneuk' 
  
  - 'peugah': "to say"


### Morphological analysis

- **-keuneuk** 'likey to'

- **-beutôi** = peu'beutôy'?
