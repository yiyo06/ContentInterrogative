### Note

- Saxon&Siemens 1996:XI

> **adi**: 'say, said'

>With the verb **dàgode** 'happen' below, the timing of the event in the two example sentences is different. In the first, with the unchanged form, the event is going to happen in the future (the word ha indicates the future to happen in the future). In the second, with the changed form **dàgot'ı̨**, the event is currently ongoing:

> **dàgode**: what happens?

> **Dàgode ha?**: What will happen?

> **Dàgot'ı̨?**: What is happening?

> In the next example, the two verbs differ from each
other in the timing of the event. The first one is for
general use; the second is only used if we are talking
about an event which is past and completed:

> **agode**: become (situation), happen, come to be

> **agòjà**: became (situation), happened, got to be

 - ası̨̀ı̜, hanì-le dè t'ası̨̀ı̜: somewhere, anywhere
AsÍ‡ geÀde. They went somewhere.

 - ası̨̀ı̨̀: Question marker of yes/no questions, whether, if

- 2007:103

> **dà-**: adv.suffix in verbs, 'how / in what way?'
