### Note

- Summary:

> **ACP- hoki** or

> **ACP- uw- a- hoki** 'where' (*yahoki, wahoki, sahoki*)

> **ACP- -a- ki** or

> **Verb- ki**

> **ACP- -o- -ni** or

> **locative prefix -a- -ni** (from where; *mwani* / *kwani*)

> **NCP- -ingahi**

- 48

> **-gamb-** 'say'

- 49: Noun classes, NCP and ACP

> P. 90: In class 1, however, it seems to be he subject marker **ya-** that is used instead of the ACP **yu-**.

- 55

> cl. 16, 17, 18 are locative classes (ha-, mu-, ku-)

- 85 'associative maker **-a-**'

> The associative **-a-** takes the ACP â€“ not counting class 1, where it consists of **u-** (the vowel of the ACP), thus forming **wa**.

- 90

> The inflected inter. can be split into *inter. pronouns* and *inter. clitic*. The inflected inter. pronoun is made up of the stem **-(i)hoki** 'where', which takes the ACPs (agreement class prefix). 

> Prefixed with the ACPs of different classes, the meaning of the inter. pronoun stretches from 'who' with the ACP of class 1 **yehoki** to 'when' with the ACP of class 7 **chihoki** when referring to *chigele* 'time', or 'what', also with class 7 when referring to *chinhu* 'thing'. With ACPs of other classes prefixed, the meaning is 'which', as in **dihoki** and **uhoki**.


> The stem **-(i)hoki** most likely contains the remnants of class 16 **ha-** and conceivably also the reference marker **-o-**.

> The vowel of the ACP is affected by a plausible underlying /i/ in most forms (cf. **gehoki** *see 'Vowel coalescence'below!*), which could be remnants of an initial vowel. As for the overt forms, the initial vowel may be present, as in **iyehoki**. (*so **ehoki** can be understood as ACP(a)- (i)hoki which goes through /a/ + /i/ -> /e/*)

- 91-92

> The two inter. clitics, or *wh-clitics*, in Kagulu, are **-ki** and **-ni**. The distinction between *clitic* and *affix* is [...] a clitic is a form that resembles a word, but that cannot stand on its own.

> **-ki** [...] can be attached to a V; more commonly to the associative **-a-** and the ACP.

> **-ni** may simply be an abbreviation of the iterrogative invariable **nhani** 'how' or ''why'; more restricted than -ki; only attached to [...] ACP and the **-o**.

- 66

> When the inter. clitics **-ki / -ni** are attached, either to the N itself as in 'nyumbaki?' 'which house?' or to the associate marker as in 'milimo yaki?' 'what works?', or to a construction consisting of the ACP and the reference marker **-o**, as **yoni** 'i- o- ni'.

- 176

> The QW is positioned in situ.

- 177

> A content question can occur without a QW if **fo-** 'as', which otherwise functions as a conjunction, is present. In this type of question, the verb *togola* 'pra/praise' may be present in spoken language. 

> Some invariable inter. have an inflected synonym such as the invariable **nani** 'who', which is synonymous with **yehoki**. The reason for this variability is [...] **nani** could be a Swahili loan and **yehoki** the original Kagulu form. 

> **yahoki / wahoki / sahoki** 'where' vs. **yehoki / wehoki / sihoki** 'who': the change in vowel is in fact a contraction of a longer form containing the verb **kuwa (uw -a)** 'to be'.

- **ku-**: ACP; **-ku-**: FUT- (P. 153); **ku** PRES (P.186)

- 45-46 'vowel harmony'

> one in the verbal derivation process [...] **/a/ or /i/ then /i/ or or **/e/ or /o/ then /e/ **

> the other instance is less governed by rules, occurs in several Subject markers, but most commonly in cl. 1, 2, 16. The vowels in prefixes are subject to variation: **ya-** (SM of cl. 1) is often written and pronounced as **ye-/yo-** and **ha-** (cl.16) as **ho-**. but not always: **ye-** instead of the standard **ya-** can occur before **u** and not just mid vowels.

- 42-45 'vowels changes in morphological processes'

> Glide formation: 

> 1) **/i/ -> /j/ 'y'** before vowels; not with negative morpheme si- nor with the NCP&ACP 'chi-'

> i + e -> **ye**

> i + a -> **ya**

> i + o -> **yo**

> i + u -> **yu**

> 2) **/u/ -> /w/** before vowels

> u + i -> **wi**

> u + e -> **we** (not common)

> u + a -> **wa**

> u + o -> **wo** (only take place between the cl1 **mu-** -> **mw**)

> Vowel coalescence:

> **/a/ + /i/ -> /e/** (k_e_na <- ka- in -a)

> **/a/ + /u/ -> /o/** (hah_o_wa <- ha- ha- uw -a)

> Vowel deletion: 

> 1) **identical vowels**

> i+i -> i

> a+a -> a

> o+o -> o

> u+u -> u

> 2) **different-quality vowels meet, the first vowel is deleted**

> i + a -> o

> i + o -> o

> i + u -> u

> a + e -> e

> a + o -> o

> u + o -> o

- **igw- a-**: igw 'PASS', 'a' here a final vowel of the verb

- **kwanani**: maybe 'ku- uw- a- nani' '2.SG.PAST- be- FV- 'who' (see P. 177 kuwa hoki 'where are you') 

- need to distinguish associative **-a-** and final vowel **a-**?; **a** without Bindstrich is initial vowel (IV)!

- 157: **ija** 'come'

- **!** in text a lot of **-ani** attested, which the contexts should be 'who', z.B. fyani, kwani; a special form of 'nani'?; keep it as 'ani-' so that it is different from 'o- ni' which means 'what'.

- **ni-**: 1SG (P. 68); **ni** 'what'

- **tend**: do
