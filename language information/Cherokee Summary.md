### Note

- Montgomery-Anderson 2008:482

> If the question focus on the identity of the subject or object the inter. pronoun appears with **úústi**. This combination is sometimes translated by speakers as 'what is it that' or 'what kind of'. The construction **kato skinúústi** is used for an identity question for an animate but nonhuman subject or object.

- Montgomery-Anderson 2008:533

> Information questions are formed by placing the appropriate QW at the beginning of the sentence. 

- Montgomery-Anderson 2008:79

> Often in casual speech the short vowels at the beginning of a ver  stem delete before the third person plural [...] This deletion is option and does not occur in careful speech. In this example the QW at the beginning is also shortended by dropped its first syllable.

- Holmes&Smith 1977:81

> In Cherokee [QW] ask questions (*which means QW can not be used for either a question or a description as a relative*)

- Holmes&Smith 1977:190

> **-ke** shows that this verb is interrogative, asks a question.

- Pulte&Feeling 1975:347-348

> Questions which can be answered appropriately with yes or no may be formed in Cherokee by the use of the question suffixes **-sgo, -ju**. Questions with 'or' (*alternative questions*) may be formed with the suffixes **-sgo, -ke**.

> The suffix **-na** 'what about' is also used to form questions.

- ulte&Feeling 1975:343

> **ale** 'and', **-le yigi** 'or', **asesgini** 'but', **iyusdi** 'because'
