 (P. 155-156: ***bo** restricted to the environment of projection, i.e reportative and quotative constructions, where it interrogates the projection, either locution ('what was said') or idea ('what was thought'); **Bʋnʋ** is however, more general and can occur in both projection and non-projection environments*)

### Note

- 148-149

> termi: **elemental (non-polar) interrogative clause**: does not require a Negotiator, rather, it is marked by the presence of a QW (Q-element).

> three types of polar inter. clauses and the respective inter. particle: 1) yes/no - neutral: **bɩ** 2) yes/no - biased - initiative: **wɛ, kpo, ʋ**; yes/no - biased - responsive: **ya**; 3) Alternative: **bɩɩ-('or') conjunction**

- 153

> [...] content questions. A pariticpant or curcumstance in the clause is queried by the speaker, and s/he expects the addressee to supply information about ehat element. Its distinctive feature is the presence of a Q-element.

> The selection of a Q-element in inter. clauses is closely linked with the potential function of the element in the clause. It may be conflated with one of four interpersonal functions, namely. Subject, Complement, Adjunct and Predicator. When it is conflated with the Subject or Predicator, it is part of the Mood base, and when it is conflated with Complement or Adjunct, it falls within the Residue.

- 154: lexicogrammatical categories of QW

> **potential clase element**: Subject/Complement, Adjunct, Predicator

> **humannness**: human, non-human

> **textual**: thematic, focal, thematic/focal, neutral

> **transitivity**: identifying, idea&locution, reason, time, place, quantity/value/attribute, quantity/value, manner/attribute, interrogative verb

> **number**: sg, pl, neutral, pl(several entites)

![QW used in elemental inter. clauses (Mwinlaaru2017:154)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33869669/87537003-3edaa080-c69a-11ea-8992-23a25d13dd72.png)

- 159: Echo questions

> Elemental inter. clauses also realise echo questions. This type of clasue is similar to the biases responsie inter.. The difference is that elemental echo questions require the addressee to supply a statement or repeat a proposition, rather than five a polar answer. In such echo questions, the inter. particle **ya** is used together with the Q-element, and it is placed clause finally as a Negtiator element.

> All five principal functions in the interpersonal clause structure, comprising Subject, Predicator, Complement, Adjunct and Negotiator, are engaged in realising different meanings in elemental inter. clauses. In addition, however, the Q-element can be a modifier in a NP ('what work') [...] The distinctive character of the elemental inter. is the presence of the Q-element in the clause.

- 160: position of the Q-element in the clause

> Teruya et al (2007) indentify three motifs [...] across several languages. 1) some languages assign the Q-element unmarked thematic status in the clause, mostly in clasue intitial position. 2) the default case is to place the Q-element in unmarked focus position (e.g. Yoruba). 3) some languages do not associate the Q-element with any special textual status of the clause. Rather, it simple occurs *in situ* as it would in the corresponding declarative clause.

> Dagaare is in situ.
