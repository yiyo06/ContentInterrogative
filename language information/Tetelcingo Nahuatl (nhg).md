### Note

- Pittman1954:38

> The inter. nearly always occurs sentence initial.

- Tuggy:29-31

> WH words tend to be initial. INTR normally precede them. Accompanying postpositions may also precede them: **ka** 'with', **pa** 'at/on', and the Spanish prepositions do so most commonly. **tli** seems to accept second positon more readily that **ɔki** 

> A topicalized element may also precede a WH word.

> A WH word may be a constituent of an embedded or even doubly embedded clause.

> **noso** 'or' often follows a WH word with a meaning sth. like 'then' or Spanish 'pues'.

**noso** precedes the WHW when used as introducer for a rhetorical question. (This is usually is done when the question is one of a series.)
