### Note

- Childs1995:111-112

> Inter. pronouns replace a QW and are fronted. The fist type (WH or **ɛ̍ɛ** words) requires a question particle **yɛ̍** to follow the finite verb of the question.

> There are long forms, formed by suffixing **nɛ̍**: **Kūɛ̍ɛ̍-nɛ̍** 'where'.

> There is an all-purpose QW which does not require a particle, **ɔ̍ɔ̄** 'where, what about'. This pronoun does not allow the suffixation of **nɛ̍**.

- Childs 1995:144
> the particle **-nɛ̍** is optionally attached to the end of inter. pronouns with no apparent change in meaning.
