### Note

- Sneddon&Adelaar et.al 2016:324

> Information questions usually have the same word order as corresponding statements. 

> If the QW is predicate of a non-verbal clause it often precedes the subject.

- Sneddon&Adelaar et.al 2016:325

> **apa** and **siapa** cannot occur as subject of a passive clause. Instead, the construction is changed to an identifying clause, with the QW as predicate. The QW is the followed by **yang**, which introduces the subject.

- **identifying *yang* construction**: 'siap yang; apa yang'

> Questions corresponding to NP clauses do not use the identifying **yang** constructions. The interrogative predicate freely occurs before or after the subject

> When **yang** does occur in NP clause questions, it has a contrastive function

- Sneddon&Adelaar et.al 2016:326

> Following a locative preposition **mana** means 'which'. Like **siapa** and **apa**, **mana** cannot be separated from the preposition [...].

- Sneddon&Adelaar et.al 2016:327

> Occuring within a NP **mana** usually follows **yang** and asks 'which (out of a known set)': 

> 'Tomo tinggal di rumah yang mana?' ("which house does Tomo live in?)

- Sneddon&Adelaar et.al 2016:328

> QW of time, reason and manner usually occur first in the clause

- Sneddon&Adelaar et.al 2016:319

> In both types (yes-no / information question) **-kah** can occur to mark the construction as a question.

- Sneddon&Adelaar et.al 2016:320

> A yes-no question can be made overtly interrogative by placing **apa** or **apakah** *before* it. This is more common in writing and formal speech.

> In this context **apa(kah)**, which is here called a *question marker*, has no lexical fuction but simple signals that what follows is a question. It must be distinguished from the question word **apa**:

> '**Apa** dia sudah makan?' (Has she eaten?)

> 'Dia sudah makan **apa**?' (What has she eaten?)

- Sneddon&Adelaar et.al 2016:329

> A sentence can be overtly marked as a question by use of **-kah**. It is always optional and is largely confined to writing and formal speech. The element to which **-kah** is attached is placed first in the question.

- Djenar2003:2

> **apa** [...] (short for **apakah**) is placed at the beginning of the sentence, whereas **apa** 'what' can also be placed at the end.

### Question:

#### *Apa*, *apakah* and *apakah yang*? How can be sure *apakah* stand for yes-no question or information question?
