> The inter. prnoun **hvem** has 3 forms: **hvem** 'common gender', **hvad** 'neuter' are chiefly nominal, i.e. used independently, whereas the genitive form **hvis** is used attributively with determinative function or independently with an implied NP.

> *? **hvad** is the neutral form of 'who' and means 'what'. Does it mean, in Danish 'what' is derived from 'who'?*

> In indirect questions, **hvem** must be followed by **der** when it is S, but not in other ues. [...] **hvem der** can introduce a sentence that expresses the speaker's wishful thingking and as such represents an 'if only I ...' type of utterance.

> In colluquial languages, **hvad** is sometimes used attributively as a synonym for **hvilken (hvilket, hvilke)** [...] hvad can modify some comparative adj in the SG.

> **hvad med / hvad om + clause** colloquially 'what/how about'.

> Since **hvem** is used about human beings and **hvad** about inanimate objects, there is a gap in the semantic field covered by these two inter. pronouns which excludes animals. 

> **hvadbehager** idiomatic 'paron?'

> **hvilken** can refer to animate and inanimate objects, but is not used very often about human beings, especially without an attached N. In such cases **hvem** is preferred.

> **hvilken** can be used to ask for either identification or description.
