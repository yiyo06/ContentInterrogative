> There are two types of polar question in Yine: the basic polar question, which is marked only by intnation, and the confirmation-type or 'expected affirmative' polar question, which is introduced by the negative particle **hi (gi)** with mirative enclitic **=he (ge)**, and has optional rising intonation.

> Alternative questions are formed by adding the 'alternative' particle **waka** and the negative noun **hike (gike)** 'no' to the clause expressing the affirmative alternative.

- Hanson 2010:321-328

> There are six single-word question terms in Yine.

> **gi**, the particle that seres polysemously as an inter. and exclamative marker, and as an adverbial question term.

> **klu**is an adjectival QW that inflects for gender and number in agreement with that noun it requires.

> **kluneru**, a derived form of **klu**, is a pornominal or adjectival QW with a more formal or emphatic sense than **klu**. It is derived from **klu** using the 'being/entity' formative **-neru(M)/-nero(F)**.

> **katu** functions as an inter. pronoun and questions a (usually) human referent. The final vowel is thematic, expressing gender in the SG [...] and probably dereives historically from an inflectional marker. The PL form is irregular and appears to have double pl marking (the PL agreement marker -na and the nominal plralizer -ne). Its close resemblance th **kna**, the pl of **klu** [...], suggests that there is a historical relationship between these two forms. 

> **gi** is also used to question direct speech.

> **giru**: 'which (one)' can function as an adjective or a pronoun; it inflects for number and gender [...]. By their morphology, the SG forms appear to be **-lu** object/property nominalizations of the question particle; this is consistent also with their meaning. The pL form is irregular, but bears a strong resemblance to the (also irregular) 3PL pronoun **wanna** [...].

> The reamainging question term in Yine are complex forms based on either **klu** or **gi**.

> **gi gixpoko** 'how, in what manner' - built on the verb **gixpoko** 'do in a certain way' - which marks the subject of the inter. clause in its pronominal prefix. **gixpoko** is a complement-taking verb, requiring the lexical verb of the clause to be marked subordinate with either **-le** 'subordinate, or with the anticipatory passive **-ko**
