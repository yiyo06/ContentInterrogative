### Note

- 311-314

> Dii yes-no questions and WH-questions use identical initial and final inter. particles, and share the same intonation patterns.

> The distinction [between yes-no and WH question] is somewhat blurred by **rhetorical questions**, which may have either a yes-no or WH-form in Dii, but expect no answer).

> As in most languages, the context of the WH-word, whether nominal, adjectival or adverbial, must be indefinite. This is a phenomenon already illustrated from a wide range of languages.

> Most Dii WH-words have two forms: one in non-final position, the other before the clause marker.

> Dii inter., then, use three structural signals in both yes-no and WH-questions: 1) an optional particle utterance-initially: **yèe(máa/tée)** or **nàà**; 2)a final particle whose basic form is **-á** but which has a large number of variants, some replacive, some additive; 3) except in the cast of the two WH-words **téé** and **néé**, a falling intonation pattern if the final sonorant(s) is long.

> **tée** and **néé** are unique because they don't have an inter. form in **-a**, and because their tone is long and level, in contrast to the falling intonation pattern of the majority of Dii inter..

- 309

> Both yes-no and WH-questions may begin with an initial particle **yèe** which optionally followed by either **máa** or **tée** (both of which are 'attention-getters' and may be glossed roughly as 'listen!' or 'then' and occur prncipally at the beginning of utterances).

> The final inter. particle usually has the basic form **-á** but is often modified by lengthening or intonational variations linked to the emotions of the speakers. [..] the high tone may be lowered by assimilation to the tone of the immediately preceding syllable or by assuming the tone of the vowel it 'replaces'.


### Question:

- 40025039 & 40025044 **tée** = **téé**? 

- 40025037/38/38/44: 'wann' not sure which word = 'time', only can identify the **téé** part

- **ndɛnná** found in three verses, is it a QW?
