### Note

- Jukes2006:350-351

> Several of these interrogatives are clearly based on the interrogative pronoun *apa*: namely the question verb **angngapa**, the numeral interrogative **siapa**, and the temporal interrogatives **ringngapanna** and **siapayya**. 

> **Apa** can be used as an indefinite pronoun 'soemething' or negated to function as a negative prnoun *tena apa* 'nothing'. 

- 351

> **apa** can appear in any position in which a N could appear, but it is most often found in focus position. 

- 352-353

> **inai** is always clause initial, i.e. in focus position. 

> When **inai** is used to ask about a non-human referent, it is assumed to refer to the owner of that referent. 

- 359

> In some example **antekamma** asks about a noun relating to manner or method, in which case there is no enclitic. In such example **antekamma** could be substituted by **apa** with no change in meaning.
