### Note

- Belle&Beller 1982:222-223

> The QW occurs first in a clause. 

> QW preposed from subordinate clause

- 211

> Relative markers are particles and occur initial in the subordinate clasue they introduce. **tlen** 'who/that'; **katli** 'who / that'.

- 237

> Objective phrase: the relators include **tlen** 'who/that/about', **katli** 'who/that', and **tlacki** 'what'. 

- 213

> **intla** 'if' (***sintla** also means 'if'?*)

- 266

> **tlake / se tlakia** 'something'; **seki / se ahkahya** 'someone'

- 268

> **aš tleno** 'nothing, none'; **tleno** 'anything'

- 292: Embedded questions

> Embedded questions do not differ in any way from main clause questions or subordinate clause sentences, except that embedded yes/no questions emply the conjunction **intle/tla** 'if', whereas independent yes/no questions have no introducer.

- 293

> QW can be used in place of the relative subordinator when the head is absent. [...] The 'ever' forms are usually identical to the WH words. The concept of 'ever' can be expresse by **onka** 'there is/be' or **weli** 'able' or **nesi** 'appear' if a different form is used.

- 294

> Adverbial relative clause [...] begin with the relator or the QW. Locative and manner clauses have a relator that is different from the QW, but the QW can also be used. **tlen** is used with oblique constituents. The 'when' clauses often omit the QW. They are not marked in any special way.

- 295

> Temporal clauses: the **kema** 'when' subordinator can be used.

> 'If' clauses are marked by the introducer **tla** or **intla**.
