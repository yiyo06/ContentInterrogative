### Basic question words

**who**: |ki(t)-| / |kin-|

*inflection and expansion similar to a nominal demonstrative (with root expander **|-na-|, |-u-| and |-ku-|**, though with some peculiarities. Desrivation may take place to a certain extent:*
 
 - **ABS.SG**: kina (1191: -na **EX.ABS**
 
 - **REL.SG**: ki-a ~ kitu-m
 
 - **non-ABS/REL SG stem**: |kit-u-|
 
  **LOC.SG**: ki-tu-mi
  
  **PRL.SG**: ki-tu-kum
  
  **EQL.SG**: ki-tu-(ce)tun
  
  **APP.3Rsg 'he being who'**: ki-tu-u-luni
 
 - **non-SG stem**: |kin-ku-|
  
  **ABE/REL.PL**: kin-ku-t
  
  **LOC.PL**: kin-ku-ni
  
  **PRL.PL**: kin-ku-tgun
  
  **EQL.PL**: kin-ku-(ce)tun
  
  **APP.3Rpl.'they being who'**: kin-ku-u-luteng
 
 - **which, who**: kitu-


**what**: ca- (to do what)

*nominally used, inflects for case and number but does not take a possessor marking*
 
 - **during what occasion**: ca-mi (less pecise than qangvaq 'when') 
 
   *ca-mi       yuurte-llru-sit?*
  
   *what-LOC.SG be-born-PST-INT.2SG*
   
   *"when were you born?"*
    
 - **ABS.SG**: ca
 
 - **REL.SG**: ca-m
 
 - **ABS/REL.PL**: ca-t
 
   cà-t          ≠  u-kú-t?
   
   *what-ABS-PL     this-EX-ABS.PL*
   
   *"what are these?" (exclamation, without predicate)
   
   _ca-u-gat_
   
   _what-be-INT.3PL_
 
 - **ABS/REL.DU**: ca-k
 
 - **ABM.SG**: ca-mek / ca-meng (P. 629: ablative-modalis case; for P function or ditransitive T function)

 - **(P.272) in what, around what time**: ca-mi (-mi LOC-SG)
 
 *Verbal used: inflected for person as an interrogative verb often inquiring as the reason 'why', as when it occurs in the causal-connective, in the appositional, or in the participial mood* 
 
**when**: |qa(ŋ)-|
  
 - **FUT**: |qaku-|
 
 - **PST**: |qaŋyaq-| (qangvaq)

 - (P.300): Ignoratives of time distinguish the past |qaŋyaq-| 'when, how long ago, some time' and future |qaku-| 'when, how long from now, some time from now'
 
 - (P. 453): the future vs. past contrast may be neutralized
 
 - **for how long**: qangvar-pak / qaku-rpak
 
 - **How long has it been**: qangva-urt-a ~ qangva-u-ga
 
 - **when-thing.of-be-INT.3pl** 'how old (things) are..': qangva-lla-u-gat 
 
 - **what time is it now?**: 'qavci-klaag-ta? ~ ca-klaag-ta'

 - (P.307): To refer to the hour (o clock), a numeral or the ignorative stem of number (|qavci-| 'how many') is used with the allative or the ablative case ; Qavci-nun / Qavci-nek **how.many-ALL.pl./-ABM.pl.**

 - (P. 317): The English expression **what time (is it)?** has entered CAY as a verb stem |wataimar-| and is used with a Yupik interrogative-mood marker


**where**: |na-|
 
 - **LOC**: na-ni
 
 - **ABL, woher**: na-ken
 
 - **ALL**: na-mun
 
 - **PRL, how/which way**: na-u͡ggun / na-w'un ~ na-gg'un
 
 - **where (is it)**: nauxu
 
 - |nauwa| ~ nauw': less formal than the verb **|na-nt-|** 'be where', and less specific than LOC |na-ni|.
 
**where/when (in relation to), what part (of)**: |nat-|
 
 *The NV suffixes 'to go where' [...] are derived with an allative marker preceeded by the NN |-t-|. 
 
 (P. 450) 
 > the suffix NN **|-t|** 'part, side' herein is common after an adverbial demonstrative root.*

> the stem |nat-| is often followed by NV suffixes, meaning 'to go where'
  
 - 'where are you going': nat-var-cit; but in P.450: nat-virc-it

 
  
 - **implies several possible destinations**: 
  
  *nat-vir-cit / nat-virte-qatar-cit*
   
  *'where are you going?' / 'where (exactly) are you about to go?'*
   
 - **may imply no known destination**:
  
  *nat(et)-murte-qatar-cit? / nat-va-qatar-cit?*
   
  *'which way, what destination, to where are you going? / where are you about to go?'*
  
 - **which one (in relation to)**: |natɨ-qliɣ-| (|-qilɣ-| 'the one located in')
 
 - **which area far toward (in relation to sth.)**: |natɨ-qvaɣ-| (|-qvaɣ-| 'far')


**why**: 

 - |ciin| / cün : *a general inter. particles for reasons; converb **ca-lriim** 'when' also.*
 
 *|ciin| is a fossilized partivle from |ca-|. [...] |ciin| originally comes from the causative-connective verb **ca-ngan** with the common change of **-anaga-** to **-ii-**. Thus the two are interchangeable **ciin ~ ca-avet**

**how**: |qai-| / |qayu-|

*|qai-|:* 

 - **particle**: qaillun ~qaill
 
 - **How/in what way, EQL**: qaillu-tun
 
 - **exactly how**: qaillu-qapik
 
 - **exactly how (more intensifying)**: qaillu(n)-qapiar
 
*The ignorative word often co-occurs with |pi-| verb 'to do' in various moods, serving like a person-inflected inter. word:*

 - **why he?**: qaillun ≠ pi-am ~ ca-ami?

*|qayu-|*: occurs in a few fossilized particles, taking the place of |qaiɬ(un) or |qavciɣ-| 

 - **How much is it?**: 
 
  *'qayu-tun aki-tu-ta-a'?*
  
  *how-EQL   value-endowed-as.as-INT.3SG*
 
 - ?natən
 
 **which**:  |naliq-|
 
 - **which one of us (inflected)**: nalir-put
 
 - **which one of them(pl)**: nali-it
 
 - **which-REL.2pl.sg**: nalir-peci
 
 - **which-ABS.3pl.sg**: nali-at
 
 - **which / who**: kitu-
 
 - **which (part)**: natə-

 - (P. 968) nali-at **which-REL.3pl.sg**; 40022028 'kia naliat'?
   
**what kind of**: 

 - *ca-kuci-mek       kuvya-mek [...] ?*
 
   *what-kind-ABM.SG   net-ABM.SG*
   
   *"what kind of net [...]?" see composite suffix |-kuciɣ-| ((§18.2.1.3)*

**how many/much**: |qavciɣ-| / qavci

 *as a nominal stem, inflects like a nummeral stem*
 
 - **how.many-ABS.PL**: qavci-n
 
 - **how.many-FRQ-ABM**: qavci-rqu-nek
 
 -**what time is it now?**: 'qavci-klaag-ta? ~ ca-klaag-ta'
 
 *as a verb stem:*
 
 -**how old are you?**: 'qavcir-cit?'
 

### Note

- New terminology: 'ignorative word / phrase', 'ignorative stems' (Miyaoka2012)

- 2012:167

> - content questions request a ignorative word or phrase (see chap. 15.2) [...] and a predicate verb in the interrogative mood (see chap. 48.2) 

> - comes at the beginning of a sentence, though it can occur later in the sentence as well.

> - One question may contain two ignorative words conjoined by the eclitic |=łu| 'and'

> Ignorative words in content questions may either be a particle 'how', an inflected adverbial adjunct 'why,when,where', or core or demoted argument 'what,who[m], which'.

- there are different types of question illustrated.

- 2012:168

> - verbs of other moods than interrogtive, may also be used to ask content questions, see chap. 47.2 for a participal-mood verb particularly with the participle /ima/ 'you know'. 

- 2012: 171

> **indefinite question**: ;how about', with the enclitic /mi/; 
> **nauwa(=mi)**: 'where(=ENC)', asking the speaker himself or somone else

- 2012:350 'root expansion'

> in order to be inflected, a demonstrative root must be expanded to become a stem by one of the exoanders, a derivation may or may not intervene between the root and the inflection

> **|-na-|** absolutive singular (folowed by [|ø| ABS.sg.)
>
> **|-u-|** non-absolutive singular
>
> **|-ku-|** non-singular (dual or plural) inflection

- 2012:444

> **na-**, **ca-** and **ki(t)-** have a limited extent of denominal derivation

> While **|ca-|** and **|ki(n)-|** inflect for **number** and **case**, **|qavcin-|** and **|na-|** inflect only for **case** (but the latter like adverbial demonstratives). The expanded (nominal) ignorative stems **|na(t)-|**, etc. that are derived from |na-| inflect for **person (possessor)**.

> A verbally inflected ignorative word functions by itself as an ignorative word that is requisite to a content question. This is also the case for interrogative clauses that consist of the ignorative **|qaillun|** or **|ca-|** and the generic bivalent stem **|pi|** 'to do; thing' in the causal-connective , appositional, or participial mood.

> Ignorative words used in conjunction with an interrogative-mood |pi-| are frequently used as a kind of set phrase for expressing uncertainty ('I am not sure how'), besides their use in asking questions.

> The intensifier VV |-qapiaɣaɣ-| or |-qapiɣc-| **-qapik, -qapiar, -qapiari, -qapig** 'very (much)', used in questions, introduces a request for more specific or true answers: qaillu-qapik 'exactly how'.

*see Jpn 'about how long' construction!*

- 2012:457
> - most of the ignorative words are non-inter., i.e. indefinite or negative.
