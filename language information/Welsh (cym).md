> 'what' and 'something', 'who' and 'someone', 'where' and 'somewhere' have identical forms. 

> wh-words' position is initial in the clause and a functionally grammatical wh-element moves to clause-initial positon living a trace with no agreement behind in the respective syntactic position. However, wh-words may also remain in situ in multiple wh-question.

- King 2003:100-101

> three words **mae, ydy/yw, sy** corresponding to 'is/are' are found after **pwy / beth** - the choice depends on the types of sentences [...] subject and object in a sentence, and [...] an identification sentence [...].

> **ydy/yw** is used in indentification sentences, of the type 'who is that?'. They are easy to spot because they contain no other verbs (nor adverb) in the clause, only a prnoun or noun referring back to the qw. But if the remainder of the english sentence (after 'is/are') includes a verb form with '-ing', or some expression of location, then this is not an identification sentence, and **ydy/yw** is ruled out in Welsh.

> If **pwy / beth** is the S of the sentence, then **sy(dd)** will follow for the present tense.

> If **pwy / beth** is the O of the sentence, then **mae** will follow with the S immediately after that.

> in the object sentences (i.e. with **mae**) above, the following VN often has SM.

> Although this S/O/identification distinction is usually found with **pwy / beth**, the principle is the same with the other interrogatives.

- King 2003:102

> [...] colloquial English often uses 'what' for 'which' when used with a N. If the meaning is 'which', then **pa** must be used in Welsh.

- King 2003:317

> Inter. subordinate clauses in indirect sentences can also be introduced by qw like **lle, pryd, beth** etc.

### Question:

- 43010032	**ba un** = **pa un**? (soft mutation from 'pa', as 'bwy' < 'pwy'?)
