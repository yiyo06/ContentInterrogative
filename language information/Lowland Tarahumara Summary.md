- **optional suffix**: -ki / -ni / -ri / -ti **or the double form** -ni-ga 

- **optional temporal emphatic suffix**: -ko (*P.18: occurs on many of the temporal words and acts almost like a temporal maker*)

- **č** occurs in all of the WH QW and could be called the marker for that category

- p. 73 a example **čukí-ga-me** 'what 's the matter?' -- chu also a question root?

**who**: 

 - čié-ri (*in text 'chie'?*))
 
 - **whose**: 
 
**what**: 

 - čé-ni / čé-na (***čé-na** sometimes acts almost like a yes/no question marker, but it requires more than a simple yes/no answer*)

 - čekilísi (*probably a fusion of **čekí** with **ilí** 'stand/be' plus the temporal marker*)
 
 - čié-ti (or 'what state')
 
 - ta-či-ri
 
 - čá (*is tightly bound to the following verb*)

**when**: 

 - čé-ni-ko

### Note

- Burgees 1984:38-41 : WH question

> WH question words occur with an optional locative **ko-** or negative **ta-** prefix, a question root **če / či / ča / sa**, an optional suffix **-ki / -ni / -ri / -ti** or the double form **-ni-ga**, and an optional temporal emphatic suffix **-ko**. **č** occurs in all of the WH QW and could be called the marker for that category. The value of the non-temporal suffixes is problematic, so they will simply be labeled SF.

> Lionnet calls **-ki** a numerical quality.

> **če** occurs with the back velar **k** and the alveolar nasl **n**. **či** occurs with the dental **t**, the dental spirant **s**, and the alveolar retroflexed vibrant **r**. A transitional vocoid is sometimes heard with **č(i)ēniko** 'when' and is more permanent in **čiéti** 'what' and **čiéri** 'who'. (*in morphological analysis keep them as they are!*))

> [...] či(ri) has become a loosely bound prefix or perhaps part of a compound word.

> **ča-lá***, 'perhaps' from **če** Q and **olá** 'do/make' (or **la** 'good'), is found in a couple of special question types

> The word **áka** appears in rhetorical-type questions and can be considered a thetorical question marker (RQ). Tarahumara pften translate it as an emphatic or 'since'. There seems to be a sense of politeness connedted with its use. 

- Burgees1984:36-37 : YES-NO question

> Rising intontion may carry the compete question meaning

> The negative **ta** (short form of **tabilé**) is used in several yes/no questions [...] **tā-ča** always occurs in imperative-type constructions [...] and is sometimes almost rhetorical.

> **pā-la** 'Q/'let's see if'/'perhaps'' is sometimes close to being a rhetorical question marker, but whereas **āka** RQ does not receie an anser, **pāla** often does. [...] also used in embedded questions.

> QW are normally initial.
