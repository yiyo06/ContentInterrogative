### Note

- Bolles&Bolles 2019:41-46

> **baax / maax / tuux** tend to shift their glottal-stopped vowels in standard conversation to regular, elongated, or glided vowels.

> **baax / maax** are combined with various suffixes to make other inter. pronouns.

> Many of the inter. words, when the suffix **-i** is affixed to them, can stand by themselves.

> The conditional particle **he** when used before an inter. pronoun or adverb has the meaning of the suffix '-ever' in English.

> **bal/baal** 'thing', **mac** 'man/one person'; the word **bic** in this context shows up only in colonial usage as the word for 'how'. The meaning of **tab** which is uncertain as used in this context, but there is a companion word **tub** which seems not to have been used in an inter. context which means 'where'. It seems that the true form for some of these inter. words should be **baal ix, bic ix, mac ix**, etc., the particle **ix** here being an inter. marker. In any case the final consonant in these cases has been dropped resulting in the modern word **baax, bix, maax**, etc. It is evident that the same process is true for **tabx/tub**, resulting in **tuux**, but the line is not quite as direct. 

> THe negative particle **mix**, an alternative word for **ma** 'no' and derived from the colonial form **ma ix**, can be prefixed to some of the inter. pronouns and adverbs to form the negation of these pronouns and adverbs. 

> P. 45: When the question 'how many' is related to a particular object then the inter. particle **hay-** is combined with the number classifier which is used for that object. [...] The three most commonly used number classifiers are **-ppel** (inanimate objects generally), **-tul** (animate objects), and **-ten** (time an action is done).

- Andrade1955: 4.31

> **baan ten ka ch'ayk le hach k'aaso?** 'why do you take the worst one?', **baan** is used instead of **baax** in this expression with an implication of absurdity or perplexity.

> For us, however, indefinites and wh-words are alike not only in their subsentential use of alternatives and anaphoric properties, but also in their issue-raising capacity. In our account, wh-words are not only like indefinites, they are indefinites. The inquisitive nature of wh-questions does not distinguish them from assertions with indefinites; it unifies them. What distinguishes the two is that wh-questions isolate this aspect of the indefinite, whereas assertions with indefinites do not.
