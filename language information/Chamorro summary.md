### Note

- **kuanto** is not native Chamorro word.

- **kao** introduces yes-no question

- **manu**: if what follows is linked by the particle **nai** or if there is a refernce to location, then the meaning of **manu** is 'where'; if what follows if linked by **na**, or if it does not refer to location or people, then the meaning of **manu** is 'which'.

- **kuanto** is followed by the linking particle **na** plus a N, or it is followed immediately by a possessed N.

- **hafa** also in common greeting

- **manhanåomanu** man-hanåo-manu (PL-'go'-'where')(Chung_2020)

- Chung 2020:495: **put** 'about

- Chung 2020:496, 503

> When an interrogative word or phrase is placed at the left edge of the
question by wh-movement, information about the displaced constituent is
registered elsewhere by two special types of agreement, which are called
**wh-agreement** and **complementizer agreement (COMP)** [...] 

> **Complementizer agreement** uses the complementizer of the constituent question to register information about the displaced constituent’s syntactic category and meaning.

> when the displaced constituent is a PP : na/nai/ni

> ~ is a NP that names a location in time or space: na/nai/ni

> other: null COMP

> COMP agreement occasionally responds to a dislpaced manner or means phrase as if it were a NP that names a location (**taimanu na/nai**)

- Chung 2020

> **mangginin** 'AGREEMNT.from'; **manhanåo** 'AGR.go'


### Question:

#### **nai** and **na**, which follow the QW, are a part of the QW construction?

  - Yes: decide the meaning of **manu**; can be found by fast-alignment; according to Chung 2020:486, there are complementizer and register information about the displaced constituent's syntactic category and meaning.

 - Chung 2020:84 'mangginin manu na guma’' (AGR.from which? LINKER house); Here, because of the 'na', 'manu' can no longer be translated into 'where', instead 'na' indicates a N following and 'manu' should be translated as 'which' 
  
  - No: always come in the 'Sa' håfa na'; have their own function and are particle; not just used for QW
