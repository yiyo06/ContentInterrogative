### Note

- Parker 1969:36-37

> The member of this class [interrogative-indefinites] are characterized by occurrence as lone or initial members of a NP which regularly adds one of the enclitics **-taq** or **-m** ~ **-mi**;

> Examples of these [interr.] stems [can be] in interrogative, non-interrogative pronominal, and indefinite functions [...] can also be exclamatory expression.

- Parker 1969:37-43

> Peson suffixes immediately follow stems of [...] pronominal interrogative-indefinite.

> Examplesof the regualr occurrence of person suffixes with pronominal interrogative-indefinite stems: **haykaykitaq kačkan** 'how many of yours are there, how many do you have?' **imaykitataq apamunki** 'what of yours will you bring'

> The occurrence of third person with **may** is idiomatic: **maytataq** 'to where' **maynintataq** 'by what route' **maymantaq** 'to where, in what direction' **mayninmantaq** 'to what part of it

> [...] pronominal interrogative-indefinites are pluralized with the suffix **-kuna** following the stem with or without a person suffix or suffixes except **-ku**, and preceeding case suffixes [..] **-kuna** is in no sense obligatory; actor and verb need not agree in number, and **-kuna** is often omitted in a context where the number is unambiguous. NP introduced by numerals or quantifying adjectives, or referring to body parts that are normally multiple, regularly omit **-kuna**.

> **-ta** with a noun stem indicates object or goal of a transitive verb. In the case of a motion verb, the goal is marked with **-ta** only when the actor is human with the sole exception introduced by **maynintataq (rin kay ñan)** 'what way does this road go?'.

> **-pi** indicats location, and is glossed "in, on, at, within, upon, while" (with nominalization) or "during" (woth names of days, months [...])

> **-pa** marks the possessive or genitive case, and when introducing a NP requires person agreement of the head (P.40)

> **-man** indicates direction, and is glossed "to, towards, into, onto, for (to get)", or "according to" (when followed by **hina** 'like')

> **-manta** is variously glossed "from, about, concerning, than, instead of, after, made of, by"

> **-wan** indicates accompaniment or means, and is glossed "with, and, by means of, accompanying, for, by"

> **-paq** indicates purpose or beneficiary, and is glossed "for, in order to", "about to", "that", or "as".

> **-rayku** indicates causality, and id glossed "because of, because"

> **-kama** is glossed "up to, as far as, until" or "while", or indicates total correspodence of the members of a group with a stated attribute": 'each one of them'

> **-pura** indicates location of a thing among others of its kind, and is usually glossed "among".

> **-Cninka / -Vnka** occuring only with quantifying phrases modifying erbs which imply distribution or receiving indicates equal distribution among members of a group.

- Parker 1969:77 "compound verbs"

> The stem **na-** 'to do, act, keep doing whatever is being done' and **ni-** 'to say, tell' following **ima** yield the stems **imana-** 'to do sth.'; to matter; to happen to' and **imani-**. **imani-** occurs only in questions. 

- Parker 1969:79

> **-pas** 'even, too, also'; **-pas** always accomoanies interrogative-indefinites stems when their function is indefinite rather than interrogative.

- Parker 1969:81-83

> In a question introduced by an interrogative-indefinites stem it is very common for this stem, or the phrase in which it is the initial member, to add **-taq** [...] is not translated here, but there is evidence that in some parts of the Ayacucho speech area only the noninitial question of a sequence may add **-taq**.

> **-ču** is negative-interrogative, occurring in yes-no question, rhetorical questions, and negations.

> **-Vm / -mi** is generally added to that phrase in the clause which indicates the most important information in the clause, often relevant to a topic made explicit i nthe same clause. [...] indicates speaking from personal experience or conviction but is not translatable. [...] in questions **-mi** occurs only with the phrase which is introduced by an interrogative-indefinites stem, or which adds **-ču**. (e.g. **imatam munanki** 'what do you want'

  - Zariquiey 2008:103
 
  > In the tradition of Quechuistic studies, the ending -m / -mi is called the validator or evidential. When this suffix appears in a sentence, it indicates that the speaker is certain of what he says, since he has been a direct witness of the events it relates. This means that the statement is based on information first hand.

> **-Vs / -si** [...] indicates heresay rather than personal experience or conviction. 

- Zariquiey 2008:98-102

> in Quechua the interrogative pronouns usually go to the beginning of the question, which can be explained as a kind of movement with respect to the position they would have in an affirmative sentence, according to the element to which they refer.

> for construct an interrogative sentence, these pronouns must be accompanied by the constraint suffix **–taq** (cf. § 14). Now these pronouns can also appear accompanied by the validating suffixes **-mi** (cf. § 8) and **-si** (cf. unit three, § 13) and, while both forms can and do alternate in speech, the question with **–taq** can be perceived as more polite. If instead of any of these two suffixes we add to the interrogative pronoun the ending **-raq** (not seen in this unit, but what does 'yet' mean), we would get one more question rebuking and rude than in the other two cases.

> these interrogative pronouns is that they can be add the case suffixes already presented (cf. § 6), to form new pronouns interrogatives.

- Zariquiey 2008:206

> **-sun**: ‘inclusive plural first person future. It has an exhortative value

- 212

2: **-man**: ‘modo potencial’ (ver § 3)
3: **-pti**: ‘subordinador.’ (ver § 10)
