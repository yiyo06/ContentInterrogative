43008019	where		“ Where is your father ? ” they asked him . “ You know neither me nor my Father , ” Jesus answered . “ If you knew me , you would know my Father also . ”
43008025a	who		“ Who are you ? ” they asked him . 
43008025b	~		Jesus answered , “ What I have told you from the very beginning .
43008033	what		“ We are the descendants of Abraham , ” they answered , “ and we have never been anybody's slaves . What do you mean , then , by saying , ‘ You will be free ’ ? ”
43008043	why		Why do you not understand what I say ? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my message .
43008046a	which one		Which one of you can prove that I am guilty of sin ? 
43008046b	why		If I tell the truth , then why do you not believe me ?
43008053	who		Our father Abraham died ; you do not claim to be greater than Abraham , do you ? And the prophets also died . Who do you think you are ? ”
43008057	~		They said to him , “ You are not even fifty years old—and you have seen Abraham ? ”
43009002	whose		His disciples asked him , “ Teacher , whose sin caused him to be born blind ? Was it his own or his parents' sin ? ”
43009010	how		“ How is it that you can now see ? ” they asked him .
43009012	where		“ Where is he ? ” they asked . “ I don't know , ” he answered .
43009016	how		Some of the Pharisees said , “ The man who did this cannot be from God , for he does not obey the Sabbath law . ” Others , however , said , “ How could a man who is a sinner perform such miracles as these ? ” And there was a division among them .
43009017	what		So the Pharisees asked the man once more , “ You say he cured you of your blindness—well , what do you say about him ? ” “ He is a prophet , ” the man answered .
43009019	how		and asked them , “ Is this your son ? You say that he was born blind ; how is it , then , that he can now see ? ”
43009026a	what		“ What did he do to you ? ” they asked . 
43009026b	how		“ How did he cure you of your blindness ? ”
43009027	why		“ I have already told you , ” he answered , “ and you would not listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Maybe you , too , would like to be his disciples ? ”
43009034	~		They answered , “ You were born and brought up in sin—and you are trying to teach us ? ” And they expelled him from the synagogue .
43009036	who		The man answered , “ Tell me who he is , sir , so that I can believe in him ! ”
43010020	why		Many of them were saying , “ He has a demon ! He is crazy ! Why do you listen to him ? ”
43010021	how		But others were saying , “ A man with a demon could not talk like this ! How could a demon give sight to blind people ? ”
43010024	how long		when the people gathered around him and asked , “ How long are you going to keep us in suspense ? Tell us the plain truth : are you the Messiah ? ”
43010032	which one		Jesus said to them , “ I have done many good deeds in your presence which the Father gave me to do ; for which one of these do you want to stone me ? ”
43010036	how		As for me , the Father chose me and sent me into the world . How , then , can you say that I blaspheme because I said that I am the Son of God ?
43011034	where		“ Where have you buried him ? ” he asked them . “ Come and see , Lord , ” they answered .
43011047	what		So the Pharisees and the chief priests met with the Council and said , “ What shall we do ? Look at all the miracles this man is performing !
43011056	what		They were looking for Jesus , and as they gathered in the Temple , they asked one another , “ What do you think ? Surely he will not come to the festival , will he ? ”
43012005	why		“ Why wasn't this perfume sold for three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor ? ”
43012027	what		“ Now my heart is troubled—and what shall I say ? Shall I say , ‘ Father , do not let this hour come upon me ’ ? But that is why I came—so that I might go through this hour of suffering .
43012034a	how		The crowd answered , “ Our Law tells us that the Messiah will live forever . How , then , can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up ? 
43012034b	who		Who is this Son of Man ? ”
43012038a	who		so that what the prophet Isaiah had said might come true : “ Lord , who believed the message we told ? 
43012038b	whom		To whom did the Lord reveal his power ? ”
43013025	who		So that disciple moved closer to Jesus' side and asked , “ Who is it , Lord ? ”
43013036	where		“ Where are you going , Lord ? ” Simon Peter asked him . “ You cannot follow me now where I am going , ” answered Jesus ; “ but later you will follow me . ”
43013037	why		“ Lord , why can't I follow you now ? ” asked Peter . “ I am ready to die for you ! ”
43014002	~		There are many rooms in my Father's house , and I am going to prepare a place for you . I would not tell you this if it were not so .
43014005	how		Thomas said to him , “ Lord , we do not know where you are going ; so how can we know the way to get there ? ”
43014009	why		Jesus answered , “ For a long time I have been with you all ; yet you do not know me , Philip ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father . Why , then , do you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
43014022	how		Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) said , “ Lord , how can it be that you will reveal yourself to us and not to the world ? ”
43016005	where		But now I am going to him who sent me , yet none of you asks me where I am going .
43016017	what		Some of his disciples asked among themselves , “ What does this mean ? He tells us that in a little while we will not see him , and then a little while later we will see him ; and he also says , ‘ It is because I am going to the Father . ’
43016018	what		What does this ‘ a little while ’ mean ? We don't know what he is talking about ! ”
43018004	who		Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him , so he stepped forward and asked them , “ Who is it you are looking for ? ”
43018007	who		Again Jesus asked them , “ Who is it you are looking for ? ” “ Jesus of Nazareth , ” they said .
43018011	~		Jesus said to Peter , “ Put your sword back in its place ! Do you think that I will not drink the cup of suffering which my Father has given me ? ”
43018021	why		Why , then , do you question me ? Question the people who heard me . Ask them what I told them—they know what I said . ”
43018023	why		Jesus answered him , “ If I have said anything wrong , tell everyone here what it was . But if I am right in what I have said , why do you hit me ? ”
43018029	what		So Pilate went outside to them and asked , “ What do you accuse this man of ? ”
43018035	what		Pilate replied , “ Do you think I am a Jew ? It was your own people and the chief priests who handed you over to me . What have you done ? ”
43018038	what		“ And what is truth ? ” Pilate asked . Then Pilate went back outside to the people and said to them , “ I cannot find any reason to condemn him .
43019009	where		He went back into the palace and asked Jesus , “ Where do you come from ? ” But Jesus did not answer .
43019015	~		They shouted back , “ Kill him ! Kill him ! Crucify him ! ” Pilate asked them , “ Do you want me to crucify your king ? ” The chief priests answered , “ The only king we have is the Emperor ! ”
43020013	why		“ Woman , why are you crying ? ” they asked her . She answered , “ They have taken my Lord away , and I do not know where they have put him ! ”
43020015a	why		“ Woman , why are you crying ? ” Jesus asked her . 
43020015b	who		“ Who is it that you are looking for ? ” She thought he was the gardener , so she said to him , “ If you took him away , sir , tell me where you have put him , and I will go and get him . ”
43021012	who		Jesus said to them , “ Come and eat . ” None of the disciples dared ask him , “ Who are you ? ” because they knew it was the Lord .
43021020	who		Peter turned around and saw behind him that other disciple , whom Jesus loved—the one who had leaned close to Jesus at the meal and had asked , “ Lord , who is going to betray you ? ”
43021021	~		When Peter saw him , he asked Jesus , “ Lord , what about this man ? ”
43021022	what		Jesus answered him , “ If I want him to live until I come , what is that to you ? Follow me ! ”
43021023	what		So a report spread among the followers of Jesus that this disciple would not die . But Jesus did not say he would not die ; he said , “ If I want him to live until I come , what is that to you ? ”
44001011	why		and said , “ Galileans , why are you standing there looking up at the sky ? This Jesus , who was taken from you into heaven , will come back in the same way that you saw him go to heaven . ”
44002008	how		How is it , then , that all of us hear them speaking in our own native languages ?
44002012	what		Amazed and confused , they kept asking each other , “ What does this mean ? ”
44002037	what		When the people heard this , they were deeply troubled and said to Peter and the other apostles , “ What shall we do , brothers ? ”
44003012a	why		When Peter saw the people , he said to them , “ Fellow Israelites , why are you surprised at this , 
44003012b	why		and why do you stare at us ? Do you think that it was by means of our own power or godliness that we made this man walk ?
44004007a	how		They made the apostles stand before them and asked them , “ How did you do this ? 
44004007b	what		What power do you have or 
44004007c	whose		whose name did you use ? ”
44004016	what		“ What shall we do with these men ? ” they asked . “ Everyone in Jerusalem knows that this extraordinary miracle has been performed by them , and we cannot deny it .
44004025a	why		By means of the Holy Spirit you spoke through our ancestor David , your servant , when he said , ‘ Why were the Gentiles furious ; 
44004025b	why		why did people make their useless plots ?
44005003	why		Peter said to him , “ Ananias , why did you let Satan take control of you and make you lie to the Holy Spirit by keeping part of the money you received for the property ?
44005004	why		Before you sold the property , it belonged to you ; and after you sold it , the money was yours . Why , then , did you decide to do such a thing ? You have not lied to people—you have lied to God ! ”
44005009	why		So Peter said to her , “ Why did you and your husband decide to put the Lord's Spirit to the test ? The men who buried your husband are at the door right now , and they will carry you out too ! ”
44007026	why		The next day he saw two Israelites fighting , and he tried to make peace between them . ‘ Listen , men , ’ he said , ‘ you are fellow Israelites ; why are you fighting like this ? ’
44007027	who		But the one who was mistreating the other pushed Moses aside . ‘ Who made you ruler and judge over us ? ’ he asked .
44007035	who		“ Moses is the one who was rejected by the people of Israel . ‘ Who made you ruler and judge over us ? ’ they asked . He is the one whom God sent to rule the people and set them free with the help of the angel who appeared to him in the burning bush .
44007049a	what kind of		‘ Heaven is my throne , says the Lord , and the earth is my footstool . What kind of house would you build for me ? 
44007049b	where		Where is the place for me to live in ?
44007052	~		Was there any prophet that your ancestors did not persecute ? They killed God's messengers , who long ago announced the coming of his righteous Servant . And now you have betrayed and murdered him .
44008031	how		The official replied , “ How can I understand unless someone explains it to me ? ” And he invited Philip to climb up and sit in the carriage with him .
44008033	~		He was humiliated , and justice was denied him . No one will be able to tell about his descendants , because his life on earth has come to an end . ”
44008034	whom		The official asked Philip , “ Tell me , of whom is the prophet saying this ? Of himself or of someone else ? ”
44008036	what		As they traveled down the road , they came to a place where there was some water , and the official said , “ Here is some water . What is to keep me from being baptized ? ”
44009004	why		He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him , “ Saul , Saul ! Why do you persecute me ? ”
44009005	who		“ Who are you , Lord ? ” he asked . “ I am Jesus , whom you persecute , ” the voice said .
44009006	~		“ But get up and go into the city , where you will be told what you must do . ”
44010004	what		He stared at the angel in fear and said , “ What is it , sir ? ” The angel answered , “ God is pleased with your prayers and works of charity , and is ready to answer you .
44010021	why		So Peter went down and said to the men , “ I am the man you are looking for . Why have you come ? ”
44010029	why		And so when you sent for me , I came without any objection . I ask you , then , why did you send for me ? ”
44010047	~		“ These people have received the Holy Spirit , just as we also did . Can anyone , then , stop them from being baptized with water ? ”
44011017a	who		It is clear that God gave those Gentiles the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ ; who was I , 
44011017b	~		then , to try to stop God ! ”
44012018	what		When morning came , there was a tremendous confusion among the guards—what had happened to Peter ?
44013025	who		And as John was about to finish his mission , he said to the people , ‘ Who do you think I am ? I am not the one you are waiting for . But listen ! He is coming after me , and I am not good enough to take his sandals off his feet . ’
44014015	why		“ Why are you doing this ? We ourselves are only human beings like you ! We are here to announce the Good News , to turn you away from these worthless things to the living God , who made heaven , earth , sea , and all that is in them .
44015010	why		So then , why do you now want to put God to the test by laying a load on the backs of the believers which neither our ancestors nor we ourselves were able to carry ?
44016030	what		Then he led them out and asked , “ Sirs , what must I do to be saved ? ”
44017018	what		Certain Epicurean and Stoic teachers also debated with him . Some of them asked , “ What is this ignorant show-off trying to say ? ” Others answered , “ He seems to be talking about foreign gods . ” They said this because Paul was preaching about Jesus and the resurrection .
44017019	what		So they took Paul , brought him before the city council , the Areopagus , and said , “ We would like to know what this new teaching is that you are talking about .
44019003	what kind of		“ Well , then , what kind of baptism did you receive ? ” Paul asked . “ The baptism of John , ” they answered .
44019015	who		But the evil spirit said to them , “ I know Jesus , and I know about Paul ; but you—who are you ? ”
44019035	~		At last the city clerk was able to calm the crowd . “ Fellow Ephesians ! ” he said . “ Everyone knows that the city of Ephesus is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of the sacred stone that fell down from heaven .
44021013a	what		But he answered , “ What are you doing , 
44021013b	~		crying like this and breaking my heart ? I am ready not only to be tied up in Jerusalem but even to die there for the sake of the Lord Jesus . ”
44021022	what		They are sure to hear that you have arrived . What should be done , then ?
44021033a	who		The commander went over to Paul , arrested him , and ordered him to be bound with two chains . Then he asked , “ Who is this man , 
44021033b	what		and what has he done ? ”
44022007	why		I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me , ‘ Saul , Saul ! Why do you persecute me ? ’
44022008	who		‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ I asked . ‘ I am Jesus of Nazareth , whom you persecute , ’ he said to me .
44022010	what		I asked , ‘ What shall I do , Lord ? ’ and the Lord said to me , ‘ Get up and go into Damascus , and there you will be told everything that God has determined for you to do . ’
44022016	why		And now , why wait any longer ? Get up and be baptized and have your sins washed away by praying to him . ’
44022026	what		When the officer heard this , he went to the commander and asked him , “ What are you doing ? That man is a Roman citizen ! ”
44023003	~		Paul said to him , “ God will certainly strike you—you whitewashed wall ! You sit there to judge me according to the Law , yet you break the Law by ordering them to strike me ! ”
44023009	~		The shouting became louder , and some of the teachers of the Law who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and protested strongly : “ We cannot find a thing wrong with this man ! Perhaps a spirit or an angel really did speak to him ! ”
44023019	what		The commander took him by the hand , led him off by himself , and asked him , “ What do you have to tell me ? ”
44026008	why		Why do you who are here find it impossible to believe that God raises the dead ?
44026014	why		All of us fell to the ground , and I heard a voice say to me in Hebrew , ‘ Saul , Saul ! Why are you persecuting me ? You are hurting yourself by hitting back , like an ox kicking against its owner's stick . ’
44026015	who		‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ I asked . And the Lord answered , ‘ I am Jesus , whom you persecute .
45002017	~		What about you ? You call yourself a Jew ; you depend on the Law and boast about God ;
45002021	why		You teach others—why don't you teach yourself ? You preach , “ Do not steal ” —but do you yourself steal ?
45002028	who		After all , who is a real Jew , truly circumcised ? It is not the man who is a Jew on the outside , whose circumcision is a physical thing .
45003001a	~		Do the Jews then have any advantage over the Gentiles ? 
45003001b	~		Or is there any value in being circumcised ?
45003003	~		But what if some of them were not faithful ? Does this mean that God will not be faithful ?
45003005	~		But what if our doing wrong serves to show up more clearly God's doing right ? Can we say that God does wrong when he punishes us ? ( This would be the natural question to ask . )
45003006	how		By no means ! If God is not just , how can he judge the world ?
45003007a	~		But what if my untruth serves God's glory by making his truth stand out more clearly ? 
45003007b	why		Why should I still be condemned as a sinner ?
45003008	why		Why not say , then , “ Let us do evil so that good may come ” ? Some people , indeed , have insulted me by accusing me of saying this very thing ! They will be condemned , as they should be .
45003009	~		Well then , are we Jews in any better condition than the Gentiles ? Not at all ! I have already shown that Jews and Gentiles alike are all under the power of sin .
45003027a	what		What , then , can we boast about ? Nothing ! 
45003027b	what		And what is the reason for this ? Is it that we obey the Law ? No , but that we believe .
45003027c	~		
45004001	what		What shall we say , then , of Abraham , the father of our race ? What was his experience ?
45004003	~		The scripture says , “ Abraham believed God , and because of his faith God accepted him as righteous . ”
45004010	when		When did this take place ? Was it before or after Abraham was circumcised ? It was before , not after .
45005010	how much		We were God's enemies , but he made us his friends through the death of his Son . Now that we are God's friends , how much more will we be saved by Christ's life !
45005021	~		So then , just as sin ruled by means of death , so also God's grace rules by means of righteousness , leading us to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord .
45006001	what		What shall we say , then ? Should we continue to live in sin so that God's grace will increase ?
45006002	how		Certainly not ! We have died to sin—how then can we go on living in it ?
45006015	what		What , then ? Shall we sin , because we are not under law but under God's grace ? By no means !
45006021	what		What did you gain from doing the things that you are now ashamed of ? The result of those things is death !
45007007	~		Shall we say , then , that the Law itself is sinful ? Of course not ! But it was the Law that made me know what sin is . If the Law had not said , “ Do not desire what belongs to someone else , ” I would not have known such a desire .
45007024	who		What an unhappy man I am ! Who will rescue me from this body that is taking me to death ?
45008024	who		For it was by hope that we were saved ; but if we see what we hope for , then it is not really hope . For who of us hopes for something we see ?
45008031a	what		In view of all this , what can we say ? 
45008031b	who		If God is for us , who can be against us ?
45008032	~		Certainly not God , who did not even keep back his own Son , but offered him for us all ! He gave us his Son—will he not also freely give us all things ?
45008033	who		Who will accuse God's chosen people ? God himself declares them not guilty !
45008034	who		Who , then , will condemn them ? Not Christ Jesus , who died , or rather , who was raised to life and is at the right side of God , pleading with him for us !
45008035	who		Who , then , can separate us from the love of Christ ? Can trouble do it , or hardship or persecution or hunger or poverty or danger or death ?
45009014	~		Shall we say , then , that God is unjust ? Not at all .
45009019a	how		But one of you will say to me , “ If this is so , how can God find fault with anyone ? 
45009019b	who		Who can resist God's will ? ”
45009020a	who		But who are you , my friend , to talk back to God ? 
45009020b	~		A clay pot does not ask the man who made it , 
45009020c	why		“ Why did you make me like this ? ”
45009021	~		After all , the man who makes the pots has the right to use the clay as he wishes , and to make two pots from the same lump of clay , one for special occasions and the other for ordinary use .
45009022	~		And the same is true of what God has done . He wanted to show his anger and to make his power known . But he was very patient in enduring those who were the objects of his anger , who were doomed to destruction .
45009023	~		And he also wanted to reveal his abundant glory , which was poured out on us who are the objects of his mercy , those of us whom he has prepared to receive his glory .
45009024	~		For we are the people he called , not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles .
45009030	~		So we say that the Gentiles , who were not trying to put themselves right with God , were put right with him through faith ;
45009032	why		And why not ? Because they did not depend on faith but on what they did . And so they stumbled over the “ stumbling stone ”
45010006	who		But what the scripture says about being put right with God through faith is this : “ You are not to ask yourself , Who will go up into heaven ? ” ( that is , to bring Christ down ) .
45010007	who		“ Nor are you to ask , Who will go down into the world below ? ” ( that is , to bring Christ up from death ) .
45010008	~		What it says is this : “ God's message is near you , on your lips and in your heart ” —that is , the message of faith that we preach .
45010014a	how		But how can they call to him for help if they have not believed ? 
45010014b	how		And how can they believe if they have not heard the message ? 
45010014c	how		And how can they hear if the message is not proclaimed ?
45010015	how		And how can the message be proclaimed if the messengers are not sent out ? As the scripture says , “ How wonderful is the coming of messengers who bring good news ! ”
45010016	who		But not all have accepted the Good News . Isaiah himself said , “ Lord , who believed our message ? ”
45011004	what		What answer did God give him ? “ I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not worshiped the false god Baal . ”
45011007	what		What then ? The people of Israel did not find what they were looking for . It was only the small group that God chose who found it ; the rest grew deaf to God's call .
45011015	what		For when they were rejected , all other people were changed from God's enemies into his friends . What will it be , then , when they are accepted ? It will be life for the dead !
45011018	how		So then , you must not despise those who were broken off like branches . How can you be proud ? You are just a branch ; you don't support the roots—the roots support you .
45011033a	who		How great are God's riches ! How deep are his wisdom and knowledge ! Who can explain his decisions ? 
45011033b	who		Who can understand his ways ?
45011034a	who		As the scripture says , “ Who knows the mind of the Lord ? 
45011034b	who		Who is able to give him advice ?
45011035	who		Who has ever given him anything , so that he had to pay it back ? ”
45014004	who		Who are you to judge the servants of someone else ? It is their own Master who will decide whether they succeed or fail . And they will succeed , because the Lord is able to make them succeed .
45014010a	why		You then , who eat only vegetables—why do you pass judgment on others ? 
45014010b	why		And you who eat anything—why do you despise other believers ? All of us will stand before God to be judged by him .
46001020a	~		
46001020b	~		
46001020c	~		
46002011	~		
46002016a	who		As the scripture says , “ Who knows the mind of the Lord ? 
46002016b	who		Who is able to give him advice ? ”
46003005a	who		After all , who is Apollos ? 
46003005b	who		And who is Paul ? We are simply God's servants , by whom you were led to believe . Each one of us does the work which the Lord gave him to do :
46004007a	who		Who made you superior to others ? 
46004007b	~		Didn't God give you everything you have ? 
46004007c	how		Well , then , how can you boast , as if what you have were not a gift ?
46004021	which		Which do you prefer ? Shall I come to you with a whip , or in a spirit of love and gentleness ?
46005002	how		How , then , can you be proud ? On the contrary , you should be filled with sadness , and the man who has done such a thing should be expelled from your fellowship .
46005012	~		
46006001	how		If any of you have a dispute with another Christian , how dare you go before heathen judges instead of letting God's people settle the matter ?
46006003	~		Do you not know that we shall judge the angels ? How much more , then , the things of this life !
46006004	~		If such matters come up , are you going to take them to be settled by people who have no standing in the church ?
46006007a	~		The very fact that you have legal disputes among yourselves shows that you have failed completely . Would it not be better for you to be wronged ? 
46006007b	~		Would it not be better for you to be robbed ?
46006009	~		Surely you know that the wicked will not possess God's Kingdom . Do not fool yourselves ; people who are immoral or who worship idols or are adulterers or homosexual perverts
46006016	~		Or perhaps you don't know that the man who joins his body to a prostitute becomes physically one with her ? The scripture says quite plainly , “ The two will become one body . ”
46006019	~		Don't you know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit , who lives in you and who was given to you by God ? You do not belong to yourselves but to God ;
46007016a	how		How can you be sure , Christian wife , that you will not save your husband ? 
46007016b	how		Or how can you be sure , Christian husband , that you will not save your wife ?
46009007a	what		What soldiers ever have to pay their own expenses in the army ? 
46009007b	what		What farmers do not eat the grapes from their own vineyard ? 
46009007c	what		What shepherds do not use the milk from their own sheep ?
46009018	what		What pay do I get , then ? It is the privilege of preaching the Good News without charging for it , without claiming my rights in my work for the gospel .
46010019a	~		Do I imply , then , 
46010019b	~		that an idol 
46010019c	~		or the food offered to it really amounts to anything ?
46010029	why		that is , not your own conscience , but the other person's conscience . “ Well , then , ” someone asks , “ why should my freedom to act be limited by another person's conscience ?
46010030	why		If I thank God for my food , why should anyone criticize me about food for which I give thanks ? ”
46011022	what		Don't you have your own homes in which to eat and drink ? Or would you rather despise the church of God and put to shame the people who are in need ? What do you expect me to say to you about this ? Shall I praise you ? Of course I don't !
46012017a	how		If the whole body were just an eye , how could it hear ? 
46012017b	how		And if it were only an ear , how could it smell ?
46012019	~		There would not be a body if it were all only one part !
46014006	what		So when I come to you , my friends , what use will I be to you if I speak in strange tongues ? Not a bit , unless I bring you some revelation from God or some knowledge or some inspired message or some teaching .
46014007	how		Take such lifeless musical instruments as the flute or the harp—how will anyone know the tune that is being played unless the notes are sounded distinctly ?
46014008	who		And if the one who plays the bugle does not sound a clear call , who will prepare for battle ?
46014009	how		In the same way , how will anyone understand what you are talking about if your message given in strange tongues is not clear ? Your words will vanish in the air !
46014015	what		What should I do , then ? I will pray with my spirit , but I will pray also with my mind ; I will sing with my spirit , but I will sing also with my mind .
46014016	how		When you give thanks to God in spirit only , how can ordinary people taking part in the meeting say “ Amen ” to your prayer of thanksgiving ? They have no way of knowing what you are saying .
46014026	~		This is what I mean , my friends . When you meet for worship , one person has a hymn , another a teaching , another a revelation from God , another a message in strange tongues , and still another the explanation of what is said . Everything must be of help to the church .
46014036	~		Or could it be that the word of God came from you ? Or are you the only ones to whom it came ?
46015012	how		Now , since our message is that Christ has been raised from death , how can some of you say that the dead will not be raised to life ?
46015029a	~		Now , what about those people who are baptized for the dead ? 
46015029b	what		What do they hope to accomplish ? 
46015029c	why		If it is true , as some claim , that the dead are not raised to life , why are those people being baptized for the dead ?
46015030a	~		And as for us—
46015030b	why		why would we run the risk of danger every hour ?
46015032	what		If I have , as it were , fought “ wild beasts ” here in Ephesus simply from human motives , what have I gained ? But if the dead are not raised to life , then , as the saying goes , “ Let us eat and drink , for tomorrow we will die . ”
46015035a	how		Someone will ask , “ How can the dead be raised to life ? 
46015035b	what kind of		What kind of body will they have ? ”
46015055a	where		“ Where , Death , is your victory ? 
46015055b	where		Where , Death , is your power to hurt ? ”
47002002	who		For if I were to make you sad , who would be left to cheer me up ? Only the very persons I had made sad .
47002016	who		For those who are being lost , it is a deadly stench that kills ; but for those who are being saved , it is a fragrance that brings life . Who , then , is capable for such a task ?
47003008	~		how much greater is the glory that belongs to the activity of the Spirit !
47003009	how much		The system which brings condemnation was glorious ; how much more glorious is the activity which brings salvation !
47006014a	how		Do not try to work together as equals with unbelievers , for it cannot be done . How can right and wrong be partners ? 
47006014b	how		How can light and darkness live together ?
47006015a	how		How can Christ and the Devil agree ? 
47006015b	what		What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever ?
47006016	how		How can God's temple come to terms with pagan idols ? For we are the temple of the living God ! As God himself has said , “ I will make my home with my people and live among them ; I will be their God , and they shall be my people . ” “ You must leave them and separate yourselves from them . Have nothing to do with what is unclean , and I will accept you .
47011011	~		Do I say this because I don't love you ? God knows I love you !
47011029a	~		When someone is weak , then I feel weak too ; 
47011029b	~		when someone is led into sin , I am filled with distress .
47012013	how		How were you treated any worse than the other churches , except that I did not bother you for financial help ? Please forgive me for being so unfair !
47012017	how		How ? Did I take advantage of you through any of the messengers I sent ?
48002014	how		When I saw that they were not walking a straight path in line with the truth of the gospel , I said to Peter in front of them all , “ You are a Jew , yet you have been living like a Gentile , not like a Jew . How , then , can you try to force Gentiles to live like Jews ? ”
48003001	who		You foolish Galatians ! Who put a spell on you ? Before your very eyes you had a clear description of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross !
48003019	what		What , then , was the purpose of the Law ? It was added in order to show what wrongdoing is , and it was meant to last until the coming of Abraham's descendant , to whom the promise was made . The Law was handed down by angels , with a man acting as a go-between .
48004009a	how		But now that you know God—or , I should say , now that God knows you—how is it that you want to turn back to those weak and pitiful ruling spirits ? 
48004009b	why		Why do you want to become their slaves all over again ?
48004010	~		You pay special attention to certain days , months , seasons , and years .
48004015	what		You were so happy ! What has happened ? I myself can say that you would have taken out your own eyes , if you could , and given them to me .
48004021	what		Let me ask those of you who want to be subject to the Law : do you not hear what the Law says ?
48004030	what		But what does the scripture say ? It says , “ Send the slave woman and her son away ; for the son of the slave woman will not have a part of the father's property along with the son of the free woman . ”
48005007a	who		You were doing so well ! Who made you stop obeying the truth ? 
48005007b	how		How did he persuade you ?
48005011	why		But as for me , my friends , if I continue to preach that circumcision is necessary , why am I still being persecuted ? If that were true , then my preaching about the cross of Christ would cause no trouble .
49004009	~		
50001018	~		It does not matter ! I am happy about it—just so Christ is preached in every way possible , whether from wrong or right motives . And I will continue to be happy ,
50001021	what		For what is life ? To me , it is Christ . Death , then , will bring more .
51002020	why		You have died with Christ and are set free from the ruling spirits of the universe . Why , then , do you live as though you belonged to this world ? Why do you obey such rules as
52002019	~		After all , it is you—you , no less than others ! —who are our hope , our joy , and our reason for boasting of our victory in the presence of our Lord Jesus when he comes .
52003009	~		Now we can give thanks to our God for you . We thank him for the joy we have in his presence because of you .
54003005	how		For if a man does not know how to manage his own family , how can he take care of the church of God ?
54006007a	what		What did we bring into the world ? Nothing ! 
54006007b	what		What can we take out of the world ? Nothing !
58001005	~		For God never said to any of his angels , “ You are my Son ; today I have become your Father . ” “ I will be his Father , and he will be my Son . ” “ All of God's angels must worship him . ”
58001013	~		
58001014	what		What are the angels , then ? They are spirits who serve God and are sent by him to help those who are to receive salvation .
58002003	how		How , then , shall we escape if we pay no attention to such a great salvation ? The Lord himself first announced this salvation , and those who heard him proved to us that it is true .
58002006a	what		Instead , as it is said somewhere in the Scriptures : “ What are human beings , O God , that you should think of them ; 
58002006b	~		mere human beings , that you should care for them ?
58003016	who		Who were the people who heard God's voice and rebelled against him ? All those who were led out of Egypt by Moses .
58003017	whom		With whom was God angry for forty years ? With the people who sinned , who fell down dead in the desert .
58003018	whom		When God made his solemn promise , “ They will never enter the land where I would have given them rest ” —of whom was he speaking ? Of those who rebelled .
58006004	how 		For how can those who abandon their faith be brought back to repent again ? They were once in God's light ; they tasted heaven's gift and received their share of the Holy Spirit ;
58007011	~		It was on the basis of the levitical priesthood that the Law was given to the people of Israel . Now , if the work of the levitical priests had been perfect , there would have been no need for a different kind of priest to appear , one who is in the priestly order of Melchizedek , not of Aaron .
58009014	how much		Since this is true , how much more is accomplished by the blood of Christ ! Through the eternal Spirit he offered himself as a perfect sacrifice to God . His blood will purify our consciences from useless rituals , so that we may serve the living God .
58010001	how		The Jewish Law is not a full and faithful model of the real things ; it is only a faint outline of the good things to come . The same sacrifices are offered forever , year after year . How can the Law , then , by means of these sacrifices make perfect the people who come to God ?
58010029a	what		What , then , of those who despise the Son of God ? 
58010029b	who		who treat as a cheap thing the blood of God's covenant which purified them from sin ? 
58010029c	who		who insult the Spirit of grace ? 
58010029d	how much		Just think how much worse is the punishment they will deserve !
58011032	~		Should I go on ? There isn't enough time for me to speak of Gideon , Barak , Samson , Jephthah , David , Samuel , and the prophets .
58012007	~		
58012009	~		
58012025	~		Be careful , then , and do not refuse to hear him who speaks . Those who refused to hear the one who gave the divine message on earth did not escape . How much less shall we escape , then , if we turn away from the one who speaks from heaven !
58013006	what		Let us be bold , then , and say , “ The Lord is my helper , I will not be afraid . What can anyone do to me ? ”
59002006	who		But you dishonor the poor ! Who are the ones who oppress you and drag you before the judges ? The rich !
59002014	what		My friends , what good is it for one of you to say that you have faith if your actions do not prove it ? Can that faith save you ?
59002016a	~		
59002016b	what		What good is there in your saying to them , “ God bless you ! Keep warm and eat well ! ” —if you don't give them the necessities of life ?
59002018	how		But someone will say , “ One person has faith , another has actions . ” My answer is , “ Show me how anyone can have faith without actions . I will show you my faith by my actions . ”
59002021	how		How was our ancestor Abraham put right with God ? It was through his actions , when he offered his son Isaac on the altar .
59003013	~		Are there any of you who are wise and understanding ? You are to prove it by your good life , by your good deeds performed with humility and wisdom .
59003017	~		But the wisdom from above is pure first of all ; it is also peaceful , gentle , and friendly ; it is full of compassion and produces a harvest of good deeds ; it is free from prejudice and hypocrisy .
59004001a	where		Where do all the fights 
59004001b	~		and quarrels among you come from ? They come from your desires for pleasure , which are constantly fighting within you .
59004012	who		God is the only lawgiver and judge . He alone can save and destroy . Who do you think you are , to judge someone else ?
59004014	~		You don't even know what your life tomorrow will be ! You are like a puff of smoke , which appears for a moment and then disappears .
60002020	what		For what credit is there if you endure the beatings you deserve for having done wrong ? But if you endure suffering even when you have done right , God will bless you for it .
60003013	who		Who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good ?
60004017	how		The time has come for judgment to begin , and God's own people are the first to be judged . If it starts with us , how will it end with those who do not believe the Good News from God ?
60004018	what		As the scripture says , “ It is difficult for good people to be saved ; what , then , will become of godless sinners ? ”
61003004	where		and will ask , “ He promised to come , didn't he ? Where is he ? Our ancestors have already died , but everything is still the same as it was since the creation of the world ! ”
61003011	what kind of		Since all these things will be destroyed in this way , what kind of people should you be ? Your lives should be holy and dedicated to God ,
62002022	who		Who , then , is the liar ? It is those who say that Jesus is not the Messiah . Such people are the Enemy of Christ—they reject both the Father and the Son .
62003012	why		We must not be like Cain ; he belonged to the Evil One and murdered his own brother Abel . Why did Cain murder him ? Because the things he himself did were wrong , and the things his brother did were right .
62003017	how		If we are rich and see others in need , yet close our hearts against them , how can we claim that we love God ?
62004020	~		If we say we love God , but hate others , we are liars . For we cannot love God , whom we have not seen , if we do not love others , whom we have seen .
62005005	who		Who can defeat the world ? Only the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God .
66005002	who		And I saw a mighty angel , who announced in a loud voice , “ Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll ? ”
66006010a	how long		They shouted in a loud voice , “ Almighty Lord , holy and true ! How long will it be until you judge the people on earth 
66006010b	~		and punish them for killing us ? ”
66006017	who		The terrible day of their anger is here , and who can stand up against it ? ”
66007013a	who		One of the elders asked me , “ Who are these people dressed in white robes , 
66007013b	where		and where do they come from ? ”
66013004a	who		Everyone worshiped the dragon because he had given his authority to the beast . They worshiped the beast also , saying , “ Who is like the beast ? 
66013004b	who		Who can fight against it ? ”
66015004a	who		Who will not stand in awe of you , Lord ? 
66015004b	who		Who will refuse to declare your greatness ? You alone are holy . All the nations will come and worship you , because your just actions are seen by all . ”
66017007	why		“ Why are you amazed ? ” the angel asked me . “ I will tell you the secret meaning of the woman and of the beast that carries her , the beast with seven heads and ten horns .
66018018	~		and cried out as they saw the smoke from the flames that consumed her : “ There never has been another city like this great city ! ”
