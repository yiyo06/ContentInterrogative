43009019	how		The Jewish leaders asked them , " Is this your son ? Are you saying he was born blind ? How can he now see ? "
43009026a	what		They questioned him : " What did he do to you ? 
43009026b	how		How did he heal your eyes ? "
43009027	why		He replied , " I already told you , and you didn’t listen . Why do you want to hear it again ? Do you want to become his disciples too ? "
43009034	how		They responded , " You were born completely in sin ! How is it that you dare to teach us ? " Then they expelled him .
43009036	who		He answered , " Who is he , sir ? I want to believe in him . "
43010020	why		Many of them said , " He has a demon and has lost his mind . Why listen to him ? "
43010021	~		Others said , " These aren’t the words of someone who has a demon . Can a demon heal the eyes of people who are blind ? "
43010024	how long		The Jewish opposition circled around him and asked , " How long will you test our patience ? If you are the Christ , tell us plainly . "
43010032	which		Jesus responded , " I have shown you many good works from the Father . For which of those works do you stone me ? "
43010036	how		So how can you say that the one whom the Father has made holy and sent into the world insults God because he said , ‘ I am God’s Son ’ ?
43011034	where		He asked , " Where have you laid him ? " They replied , " Lord , come and see . "
43011047	what		Then the chief priests and Pharisees called together the council and said , " What are we going to do ? This man is doing many miraculous signs !
43011056	what		They were looking for Jesus . As they spoke to each other in the temple , they said , " What do you think ? He won’t come to the festival , will he ? "
43012005	why		" This perfume was worth a year’s wages ! Why wasn’t it sold and the money given to the poor ? " (
43012027	what		" Now I am deeply troubled . What should I say ? ‘ Father , save me from this time ’ ? No , for this is the reason I have come to this time .
43012034a	how		The crowd responded , " We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever . How can you say that the Human One must be lifted up ? 
43012034b	who		Who is this Human One ? "
43012038a	who		This was to fulfill the word of the prophet Isaiah : Lord , who has believed through our message ? 
43012038b	whom		To whom is the arm of the Lord fully revealed ?
43013025	who		Leaning back toward Jesus , this disciple asked , " Lord , who is it ? "
43013036	where		Simon Peter said to Jesus , " Lord , where are you going ? " Jesus answered , " Where I am going , you can’t follow me now , but you will follow later . "
43013037	why		Peter asked , " Lord , why can’t I follow you now ? I’ll give up my life for you . "
43014002	~		My Father’s house has room to spare . If that weren’t the case , would I have told you that I’m going to prepare a place for you ?
43014005	how		Thomas asked , " Lord , we don’t know where you are going . How can we know the way ? "
43014009	how		Jesus replied , “ Don’t you know me , Philip , even after I have been with you all this time ? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father . How can you say , ‘ Show us the Father ’ ?
43014022	why		Judas ( not Judas Iscariot ) asked , " Lord , why are you about to reveal yourself to us and not to the world ? "
43016005	where		But now I go away to the one who sent me . None of you ask me , ‘ Where are you going ? ’
43016017	what		Some of Jesus’ disciples said to each other , " What does he mean : ‘ Soon you won’t see me , and soon after that you will see me ’ and ‘ Because I’m going to the Father ’ ?
43016018	what		What does he mean by ‘ soon ’ ? We don’t understand what he’s talking about . "
43018004	who		Jesus knew everything that was to happen to him , so he went out and asked , " Who are you looking for ? "
43018007	who		He asked them again , " Who are you looking for ? " They said , " Jesus the Nazarene . "
43018011	~		Jesus told Peter , " Put your sword away ! Am I not to drink the cup the Father has given me ? "
43018021	why		Why ask me ? Ask those who heard what I told them . They know what I said . "
43018023	why		Jesus replied , " If I speak wrongly , testify about what was wrong . But if I speak correctly , why do you strike me ? "
43018029	what		So Pilate went out to them and asked , " What charge do you bring against this man ? "
43018035	what		Pilate responded , " I’m not a Jew , am I ? Your nation and its chief priests handed you over to me . What have you done ? "
43018038	what		" What is truth ? " Pilate asked . After Pilate said this , he returned to the Jewish leaders and said , " I find no grounds for any charge against him .
43019009	where		He went back into the residence and spoke to Jesus , " Where are you from ? " Jesus didn’t answer .
43019015	what		The Jewish leaders cried out , " Take him away ! Take him away ! Crucify him ! " Pilate responded , " What ? Do you want me to crucify your king ? " " We have no king except the emperor , " the chief priests answered .
43020013	why		The angels asked her , " Woman , why are you crying ? " She replied , " They have taken away my Lord , and I don’t know where they’ve put him . "
43020015a	why		Jesus said to her , " Woman , why are you crying ? 
43020015b	who		Who are you looking for ? " Thinking he was the gardener , she replied , " Sir , if you have carried him away , tell me where you have put him and I will get him . "
43021012	who		Jesus said to them , " Come and have breakfast . " None of the disciples could bring themselves to ask him , " Who are you ? " They knew it was the Lord .
43021020	who		Peter turned around and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them . This was the one who had leaned against Jesus at the meal and asked him , " Lord , who is going to betray you ? "
43021021	~		When Peter saw this disciple , he said to Jesus , " Lord , what about him ? "
43021022	what		Jesus replied , " If I want him to remain until I come , what difference does that make to you ? You must follow me . "
43021023	what		Therefore , the word spread among the brothers and sisters that this disciple wouldn’t die . However , Jesus didn’t say he wouldn’t die , but only , " If I want him to remain until I come , what difference does that make to you ? "
44001011	why		They said , " Galileans , why are you standing here , looking toward heaven ? This Jesus , who was taken up from you into heaven , will come in the same way that you saw him go into heaven . "
44002008	how		How then can each of us hear them speaking in our native language ?
44002012	what		They were all surprised and bewildered . Some asked each other , " What does this mean ? "
44002037	what		When the crowd heard this , they were deeply troubled . They said to Peter and the other apostles , " Brothers , what should we do ? "
44003012a	why		Seeing this , Peter addressed the people : “ You Israelites , why are you amazed at this ? 
44003012b	why		Why are you staring at us as if we made him walk by our own power or piety ?
44004007a	~		
44004007b	what		They had Peter and John brought before them and asked , " By what power 
44004007c	what		or in what name did you do this ? "
44004016	what		" What should we do with these men ? Everyone living in Jerusalem is aware of the sign performed through them . It’s obvious to everyone and we can’t deny it .
44004025a	why		You are the one who spoke by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David , your servant : Why did the Gentiles rage , 
44004025b	~		and the peoples plot in vain ?
44005003	how		Peter asked , " Ananias , how is it that Satan has influenced you to lie to the Holy Spirit by withholding some of the proceeds from the sale of your land ?
44005004	what		Wasn’t that property yours to keep ? After you sold it , wasn’t the money yours to do with whatever you wanted ? What made you think of such a thing ? You haven’t lied to other people but to God ! "
44005009	how		He replied , " How could you scheme with each other to challenge the Lord’s Spirit ? Look ! The feet of those who buried your husband are at the door . They will carry you out too . "
44007026	why		The next day he came upon some Israelites who were caught up in an argument . He tried to make peace between them by saying , ‘ You are brothers ! Why are you harming each other ? ’
44007027	who		The one who started the fight against his neighbor pushed Moses aside and said , ‘ Who appointed you as our leader and judge ?
44007035	who		“ This is the same Moses whom they rejected when they asked , ‘ Who appointed you as our leader and judge ? ’ This is the Moses whom God sent as leader and deliverer . God did this with the help of the angel who appeared before him in the bush .
44007049a	what kind of		Heaven is my throne , and the earth is my footstool . ‘ What kind of house will you build for me , ’ says the Lord , 
44007049b	where		‘ or where is my resting place ?
44007052	~		Was there a single prophet your ancestors didn’t harass ? They even killed those who predicted the coming of the righteous one , and you’ve betrayed and murdered him !
44008031	how		The man replied , " Without someone to guide me , how could I ? " Then he invited Philip to climb up and sit with him .
44008033	who		In his humiliation justice was taken away from him . Who can tell the story of his descendants
44008034	whom		The eunuch asked Philip , " Tell me , about whom does the prophet say this ? Is he talking about himself or someone else ? "
44008036	what		As they went down the road , they came to some water . The eunuch said , " Look ! Water ! What would keep me from being baptized ? "
44009004	why		He fell to the ground and heard a voice asking him , " Saul , Saul , why are you harassing me ? "
44009005	who		Saul asked , " Who are you , Lord ? " " I am Jesus , whom you are harassing , " came the reply .
44009006	~		" Now get up and enter the city . You will be told what you must do . "
44010004	what		Startled , he stared at the angel and replied , " What is it , Lord ? " The angel said , " Your prayers and your compassionate acts are like a memorial offering to God .
44010021	why		So Peter went downstairs and told them , " I’m the one you are looking for . Why have you come ? "
44010029	why		For this reason , when you sent for me , I came without objection . I want to know , then , why you sent for me . "
44010047	~		" These people have received the Holy Spirit just as we have . Surely no one can stop them from being baptized with water , can they ? "
44011017a	who		If God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ , then who am I ? 
44011017b	~		Could I stand in God’s way ? "
44012018	what		The next morning the soldiers were flustered about what had happened to Peter .
44013025	who		As John was completing his mission , he said , ‘ Who do you think I am ? I’m not the one you think I am , but he is coming after me . I’m not worthy to loosen his sandals . ’
44014015	what		" People , what are you doing ? We are humans too , just like you ! We are proclaiming the good news to you : turn to the living God and away from such worthless things . He made the heaven , the earth , the sea , and everything in them .
44015010	why		Why then are you now challenging God by placing a burden on the shoulders of these disciples that neither we nor our ancestors could bear ?
44016030	what		He led them outside and asked , " Honorable masters , what must I do to be rescued ? "
44017018	what		Certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers engaged him in discussion too . Some said , " What an amateur ! What’s he trying to say ? " Others remarked , " He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods . " ( They said this because he was preaching the good news about Jesus and the resurrection . )
44017019	what		They took him into custody and brought him to the council on Mars Hill . " What is this new teaching ? Can we learn what you are talking about ?
44019003	what		Then he said , " What baptism did you receive , then ? " They answered , " John’s baptism . "
44019015	who		The evil spirit replied , " I know Jesus and I’m familiar with Paul , but who are you ? "
44019035	~		The city manager brought order to the crowd and said , " People of Ephesus , doesn’t everyone know that the city of Ephesus is guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image , which fell from heaven ?
44021013a	why		Paul replied , " Why are you doing this ? 
44021013b	why		Why are you weeping and breaking my heart ? I’m ready not only to be arrested but even to die in Jerusalem for the sake of the name of the Lord Jesus . "
44021022	~		What about this ? Without a doubt , they will hear that you have arrived .
44021033a	who		When the commander arrived , he arrested Paul and ordered him to be bound with two chains . Only then did he begin to ask who Paul was 
44021033b	what		and what he had done .
44022007	why		I fell to the ground and heard a voice asking me , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you harassing me ? ’
44022008	who		I answered , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ ‘ I am Jesus the Nazarene , whom you are harassing , ’ he replied .
44022010	what		I asked , ‘ What should I do , Lord ? ’ ‘ Get up , ’ the Lord replied , ‘ and go into Damascus . There you will be told everything you have been appointed to do . ’
44022016	what		What are you waiting for ? Get up , be baptized , and wash away your sins as you call on his name . ’
44022026	what		When the centurion heard this , he went to the commander and reported it . He asked , " What are you about to do ? This man is a Roman citizen ! "
44023003	~		Then Paul said to him , " God is about to strike you , you whitewashed wall ! You sit and judge me according to the Law , yet disobey the Law by ordering that I be struck . "
44023009	~		Council members were shouting loudly . Some Pharisees who were legal experts stood up and insisted forcefully , " We find nothing wrong with this man ! What if a spirit or angel has spoken to him ? "
44023019	what		The commander took him by the hand and withdrew to a place where they could speak privately . He asked , " What do you have to report to me ? "
44026008	why		Why is it inconceivable to you that God raises the dead ?
44026014	why		We all fell to the ground , and I heard a voice that said to me in Aramaic , ‘ Saul , Saul , why are you harassing me ? It’s hard for you to kick against a spear . ’
44026015	who		Then I said , ‘ Who are you , Lord ? ’ The Lord replied , ‘ I am Jesus , whom you are harassing .
45002017	~		But , if you call yourself a Jew ; if you rely on the Law ; if you brag about your relationship to God ;
45002021	why		then why don’t you who are teaching others teach yourself ? If you preach , " No stealing , " do you steal ?
45002028	~		It isn’t the Jew who maintains outward appearances who will receive praise from God , and it isn’t people who are outwardly circumcised on their bodies .
45003001a	what		So what’s the advantage of being a Jew ? 
45003001b	what		Or what’s the benefit of circumcision ?
45003003	what		What does it matter , then , if some weren’t faithful ? Their lack of faith won’t cancel God’s faithfulness , will it ?
45003005	what		But if our lack of righteousness confirms God’s justice , what will we say ? That God , who brings wrath upon us , isn’t just ( I’m speaking rhetorically ) ?
45003006	how		Absolutely not ! If God weren’t just , how could he judge the world ?
45003007a	~		But if God’s truth is demonstrated by my lie and it increases his glory , 
45003007b	why		why am I still judged as a sinner ?
45003008	why		Why not say , " Let’s do evil things so that good things will come out of it " ? ( Some people who slander us accuse us of saying that , but these people deserve criticism . )
45003009	what		So what are we saying ? Are we better off ? Not at all . We have already stated the charge : both Jews and Greeks are all under the power of sin .
45003027a	what		What happens to our bragging ? It’s thrown out . 
45003027b	which		With which law ? 
45003027c	what		With what we have accomplished under the Law ?
45004001	what		So what are we going to say ? Are we going to find that Abraham is our ancestor on the basis of genealogy ?
45004003	what		What does the scripture say ? Abraham had faith in God , and it was credited to him as righteousness .
45004010	how		So how was it credited ? When he was circumcised , or when he wasn’t circumcised ? In fact , it was credited while he still wasn’t circumcised , not after he was circumcised .
45005010	how much		If we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son while we were still enemies , now that we have been reconciled , how much more certain is it that we will be saved by his life ?
45005021	~		The result is that grace will rule through God’s righteousness , leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord , just as sin ruled in death .
45006001	what		So what are we going to say ? Should we continue sinning so grace will multiply ?
45006002	how		Absolutely not ! All of us died to sin . How can we still live in it ?
45006015	what		So what ? Should we sin because we aren’t under Law but under grace ? Absolutely not !
45006021	what		What consequences did you get from doing things that you are now ashamed of ? The outcome of those things is death .
45007007	what		So what are we going to say ? That the Law is sin ? Absolutely not ! But I wouldn’t have known sin except through the Law . I wouldn’t have known the desire for what others have if the Law had not said , Don’t desire what others have .
45007024	who		I’m a miserable human being . Who will deliver me from this dead corpse ?
45008024	who		We were saved in hope . If we see what we hope for , that isn’t hope . Who hopes for what they already see ?
45008031a	what		So what are we going to say about these things ? 
45008031b	who		If God is for us , who is against us ?
45008032	~		He didn’t spare his own Son but gave him up for us all . Won’t he also freely give us all things with him ?
45008033	who		Who will bring a charge against God’s elect people ? It is God who acquits them .
45008034	who		Who is going to convict them ? It is Christ Jesus who died , even more , who was raised , and who also is at God’s right side . It is Christ Jesus who also pleads our case for us .
45008035	who		Who will separate us from Christ’s love ? Will we be separated by trouble , or distress , or harassment , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ?
45009014	what		So what are we going to say ? Isn’t this unfair on God’s part ? Absolutely not !
45009019a	why		So you are going to say to me , " Then why does he still blame people ? 
45009019b	who		Who has ever resisted his will ? "
45009020a	who		You are only a human being . Who do you think you are to talk back to God ? 
45009020b	~		Does the clay say to the potter , 
45009020c	why		" Why did you make me like this ? "
45009021	~		Doesn’t the potter have the power over the clay to make one pot for special purposes and another for garbage from the same lump of clay ?
45009022	~		What if God very patiently puts up with pots made for wrath that were designed for destruction , because he wanted to show his wrath and to make his power known ?
45009023	~		What if he did this to make the wealth of his glory known toward pots made for mercy , which he prepared in advance for glory ?
45009024	~		We are the ones God has called . We don’t come only from the Jews but we also come from the Gentiles .
45009030	what		So what are we going to say ? Gentiles who weren’t striving for righteousness achieved righteousness , the righteousness that comes from faith .
45009032	why		Why ? It’s because they didn’t go for it by faith but they went for it as if it could be reached by doing something . They have tripped over a stumbling block .
45010006	who		But the righteousness that comes from faith talks like this : Don’t say in your heart , " Who will go up into heaven ? " ( that is , to bring Christ down )
45010007	who		or " Who will go down into the region below ? " ( that is , to bring Christ up from the dead ) .
45010008	what		But what does it say ? The word is near you , in your mouth and in your heart ( that is , the message of faith that we preach ) .
45010014a	how		So how can they call on someone they don’t have faith in ? 
45010014b	how		And how can they have faith in someone they haven’t heard of ? 
45010014c	how		And how can they hear without a preacher ?
45010015	how		And how can they preach unless they are sent ? As it is written , How beautiful are the feet of those who announce the good news .
45010016	who		But everyone hasn’t obeyed the good news . As Isaiah says , Lord , who has had faith in our message ?
45011004	what		But what is God’s reply to him ? I have kept for myself seven thousand people who haven’t bowed their knees to Baal .
45011007	what		So what ? Israel didn’t find what it was looking for . Those who were chosen found it , but the others were resistant .
45011015	how		If their rejection has brought about a close relationship between God and the world , how can their acceptance mean anything less than life from the dead ?
45011018	~		then don’t brag like you’re better than the other branches . If you do brag , be careful : it’s not you that sustains the root , but it’s the root that sustains you .
45011033a	~		God’s riches , wisdom , and knowledge are so deep ! They are as mysterious as his judgments , 
45011033b	~		and they are as hard to track as his paths !
45011034a	who		Who has known the Lord’s mind ? 
45011034b	who		Or who has been his mentor ?
45011035	who		Or who has given him a gift and has been paid back by him ?
45014004	who		Who are you to judge someone else’s servants ? They stand or fall before their own Lord ( and they will stand , because the Lord has the power to make them stand ) .
45014010a	why		But why do you judge your brother or sister ? 
45014010b	why		Or why do you look down on your brother or sister ? We all will stand in front of the judgment seat of God .
46001020a	where		Where are the wise ? 
46001020b	where		Where are the legal experts ? 
46001020c	where		Where are today’s debaters ? Hasn’t God made the wisdom of the world foolish ?
46002011	who		Who knows a person’s depths except their own spirit that lives in them ? In the same way , no one has known the depths of God except God’s Spirit .
46002016a	who		Who has known the mind of the Lord , 
46002016b	who		who will advise him ? But we have the mind of Christ .
46003005a	what		After all , what is Apollos ? 
46003005b	what		What is Paul ? They are servants who helped you to believe . Each one had a role given to them by the Lord :
46004007a	who		Who says that you are better than anyone else ? 
46004007b	what		What do you have that you didn’t receive ? 
46004007c	why		And if you received it , then why are you bragging as if you didn’t receive it ?
46004021	which		Which do you want ? Should I come to you with a big stick to punish you , or with love and a gentle spirit ?
46005002	~		And you’re proud of yourselves instead of being so upset that the one who did this thing is expelled from your community .
46005012	what		What do I care about judging outsiders ? Isn’t it your job to judge insiders ?
46006001	~		When someone in your assembly has a legal case against another member , do they dare to take it to court to be judged by people who aren’t just , instead of by God’s people ?
46006003	why		Don’t you know that we will judge angels ? Why not ordinary things ?
46006004	~		So then if you have ordinary lawsuits , do you appoint people as judges who aren’t respected by the church ?
46006007a	why		The fact that you have lawsuits against each other means that you’ve already lost your case . Why not be wronged instead ? 
46006007b	why		Why not be cheated ?
46006009	~		Don’t you know that people who are unjust won’t inherit God’s kingdom ? Don’t be deceived . Those who are sexually immoral , those who worship false gods , adulterers , both participants in same-sex intercourse ,
46006016	~		Don’t you know that anyone who is joined to someone who is sleeping around is one body with that person ? The scripture says , The two will become one flesh .
46006019	~		Or don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you ? Don’t you know that you have the Holy Spirit from God , and you don’t belong to yourselves ?
46007016a	how		How do you know as a wife if you will save your husband ? 
46007016b	how		Or how do you know as a husband if you will save your wife ?
46009007a	who		Who joins the army and pays their own way ? 
46009007b	who		Who plants a vineyard and doesn’t eat its fruit ? 
46009007c	who		Who shepherds a flock and doesn’t drink its milk ?
46009018	what		What reward do I get ? That when I preach , I offer the good news free of charge . That’s why I don’t use the rights to which I’m entitled through the gospel .
46010019a	what		What am I saying then ? 
46010019b	~		That food sacrificed to a false god is anything , 
46010019c	~		or that a false god is anything ?
46010029	why		Now when I say " conscience " I don’t mean yours but the other person’s . Why should my freedom be judged by someone else’s conscience ?
46010030	why		If I participate with gratitude , why should I be blamed for food I thank God for ?
46011022	what		Don’t you have houses to eat and drink in ? Or do you look down on God’s churches and humiliate those who have nothing ? What can I say to you ? Will I praise you ? No , I don’t praise you in this .
46012017a	what		If the whole body were an eye , what would happen to the hearing ? 
46012017b	what		And if the whole body were an ear , what would happen to the sense of smell ?
46012019	what		If all were one and the same body part , what would happen to the body ?
46014006	how		After all , brothers and sisters , if I come to you speaking in tongues , how will I help you unless I speak to you with a revelation , some knowledge , a prophecy , or a teaching ?
46014007	how		Likewise , things that aren’t alive like a harp or a lyre can make a sound , but if there aren’t different notes in the sounds they make , how will the tune from the harp or the lyre be recognized ?
46014008	who		And if a trumpet call is unrecognizable , then who will prepare for battle ?
46014009	how		It’s the same way with you : If you don’t use language that is easy to understand when you speak in a tongue , then how will anyone understand what is said ?
46014015	what		What should I do ? I’ll pray in the Spirit , but I’ll pray with my mind too ; I’ll sing a psalm in the Spirit , but I’ll sing the psalm with my mind too .
46014016	how		After all , if you praise God in the Spirit , how will the people who aren’t trained in that language say " Amen ! " to your thanksgiving , when they don’t know what you are saying ?
46014026	what		What is the outcome of this , brothers and sisters ? When you meet together , each one has a psalm , a teaching , a revelation , a tongue , or an interpretation . All these things must be done to build up the church .
46014036	~		Did the word of God originate with you ? Has it come only to you ?
46015012	how		So if the message that is preached says that Christ has been raised from the dead , then how can some of you say , " There’s no resurrection of the dead " ?
46015029a	~		
46015029b	what		Otherwise , what are those who are getting baptized for the dead doing ? 
46015029c	why		If the dead aren’t raised , then why are they being baptized for them ?
46015030a	~		And what about us ? 
46015030b	why		Why are we in danger all day every day ?
46015032	what		From a human point of view , what good does it do me if I fought wild animals in Ephesus ? If the dead aren’t raised , let’s eat and drink because tomorrow we’ll die .

47002016	who		We smell like a contagious dead person to those who are dying , but we smell like the fountain of life to those who are being saved . Who is qualified for this kind of ministry ?
47003008	~		Won’t the ministry of the Spirit be much more glorious ?
47003009	how much		If the ministry that brought condemnation has glory , how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness ?

47006015b	what		What does a believer have in common with someone who doesn’t believe ?

47011011	why		Why ? Is it because I don’t love you ? God knows that I do !
47011029a	who		Who is weak without me being weak ? 
47011029b	who		Who is led astray without me being furious about it ?

48002014	how		But when I saw that they weren’t acting consistently with the truth of the gospel , I said to Cephas in front of everyone , " If you , though you’re a Jew , live like a Gentile and not like a Jew , how can you require the Gentiles to live like Jews ? "
48003001	who		You irrational Galatians ! Who put a spell on you ? Jesus Christ was put on display as crucified before your eyes !
48003019	why		So why was the Law given ? It was added because of offenses , until the descendant would come to whom the promise had been made . It was put in place through angels by the hand of a mediator .
48004009a	how		But now , after knowing God ( or rather , being known by God ) , how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless world system ? 
48004009b	~		Do you want to be slaves to it again ?

48004021	~		Tell me — those of you who want to be under the Law — don’t you listen to the Law ?
48004030	what		But what does the scripture say ? Throw out the slave woman and her son , because the slave woman’s son won’t share the inheritance with the free woman’s son .

50001021	~		Because for me , living serves Christ and dying is even better .
51002020	why		If you died with Christ to the way the world thinks and acts , why do you submit to rules and regulations as though you were living in the world ?
52002019	what		What is our hope , joy , or crown that we can brag about in front of our Lord Jesus when he comes ? Isn’t it all of you ?
52003009	how		How can we thank God enough for you , given all the joy we have because of you before our God ?
54003005	how		because if they don’t know how to manage their own household , how can they take care of God’s church ?
54006007a	~		We didn’t bring anything into the world 
54006007b	~		and so we can’t take anything out of it :
58001005	when		After all , when did God ever say to any of the angels : You are my Son . Or , even , I will be his Father ,
58001013	when		When has he ever said to any of the angels , Sit at my right side
58001014	~		Aren’t all the angels ministering spirits who are sent to serve those who are going to inherit salvation ?
58002003	how		how will we escape if we ignore such a great salvation ? It was first announced through the Lord , and then it was confirmed by those who heard him .
58002006a	what		Instead , someone declared somewhere , What is humanity that you think about them ?
58002006b	~		
58003016	who		Who was it who rebelled when they heard his voice ? Wasn’t it all of those who were brought out of Egypt by Moses ?
58003017	whom		And with whom was God angry for forty years ? Wasn’t it with the ones who sinned , whose bodies fell in the desert ?
58003018	whom		And against whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest , if not against the ones who were disobedient ?
58006004	~		Because it’s impossible to restore people to changed hearts and lives who turn away once they have seen the light , tasted the heavenly gift , become partners with the Holy Spirit ,
58007011	why		So if perfection came through the levitical office of priest ( for the people received the Law under the priests ) , why was there still a need to speak about raising up another priest according to the order of Melchizedek rather than one according to the order of Aaron ?
58009014	how much		how much more will the blood of Jesus wash our consciences clean from dead works in order to serve the living God ? He offered himself to God through the eternal Spirit as a sacrifice without any flaw .
58010001	~		The Law is a shadow of the good things that are coming , not the real things themselves . It never can perfect the ones who are trying to draw near to God through the same sacrifices that are offered continually every year .
58010029a	how much		How much worse punishment do you think is deserved by the person 
58010029b	~		who walks all over God’s Son , 
58010029c	~		who acts as if the blood of the covenant that made us holy is just ordinary blood , 
58010029d	~		and who insults the Spirit of grace ?

58012007	what		Bear hardship for the sake of discipline . God is treating you like sons and daughters ! What child isn’t disciplined by his or her father ?
58012009	how much		What’s more , we had human parents who disciplined us , and we respected them for it . How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live ?
58012025	how		See to it that you don’t resist the one who is speaking . If the people didn’t escape when they refused to listen to the one who warned them on earth , how will we escape if we reject the one who is warning from heaven ?
58013006	what		This is why we can confidently say , The Lord is my helper , and I won’t be afraid . What can people do to me ?
59002006	~		But you have dishonored the poor . Don’t the wealthy make life difficult for you ? Aren’t they the ones who drag you into court ?
59002014	what		My brothers and sisters , what good is it if people say they have faith but do nothing to show it ? Claiming to have faith can’t save anyone , can it ?
59002016a	~		What if one of you said , " Go in peace ! Stay warm ! Have a nice meal ! " ? 
59002016b	what		What good is it if you don’t actually give them what their body needs ?
59002018	how		Someone might claim , " You have faith and I have action . " But how can I see your faith apart from your actions ? Instead , I’ll show you my faith by putting it into practice in faithful action .
59002021	~		What about Abraham , our father ? Wasn’t he shown to be righteous through his actions when he offered his son Isaac on the altar ?
59003013	~		Are any of you wise and understanding ? Show that your actions are good with a humble lifestyle that comes from wisdom .
59003017	what		What of the wisdom from above ? First , it is pure , and then peaceful , gentle , obedient , filled with mercy and good actions , fair , and genuine .
59004001a	what		What is the source of conflict among you ? 
59004001b	what		What is the source of your disputes ? Don’t they come from your cravings that are at war in your own lives ?
59004012	who		There is only one lawgiver and judge , and he is able to save and to destroy . But you who judge your neighbor , who are you ?
59004014	what		You don’t really know about tomorrow . What is your life ? You are a mist that appears for only a short while before it vanishes .
60002020	what		But what praise comes from enduring patiently when you have sinned and are beaten for it ? But if you endure steadfastly when you’ve done good and suffer for it , this is commendable before God .
60003013	who		Who will harm you if you are zealous for good ?
60004017	what		because it’s time for judgment to begin with God’s own household . But if judgment starts with us , what will happen to those who refuse to believe God’s good news ?
60004018	what		If the righteous are barely rescued , what will happen to the godless and sinful ?
61003004	where		and saying , " Where is the promise of his coming ? After all , nothing has changed — not since the beginning of creation , nor even since the ancestors died . "
61003011	what sort of		Since everything will be destroyed in this way , what sort of people ought you to be ? You must live holy and godly lives ,
62002022	who		Who is the liar ? Isn’t it the person who denies that Jesus is the Christ ? This person is the antichrist : the one who denies the Father and the Son .
62003012	why		Don’t behave like Cain , who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother . And why did he kill him ? He killed him because his own works were evil , but the works of his brother were righteous .
62003017	how		But if a person has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need and that person doesn’t care — how can the love of God remain in him ?
62004020	~		If anyone says , I love God , and hates a brother or sister , he is a liar , because the person who doesn’t love a brother or sister who can be seen can’t love God , who can’t be seen .
62005005	who		Who defeats the world ? Isn’t it the one who believes that Jesus is God’s Son ?
66005002	who		I saw a powerful angel , who proclaimed in a loud voice , " Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals ? "
66006010a	how long		They cried out with a loud voice , " Holy and true Master , how long will you wait before you pass judgment ? 
66006010b	how long		How long before you require justice for our blood , which was shed by those who live on earth ? "

66015004b	~		and glorify your name ? All nations will come and fall down in worship before you ,
66017007	why		Then the angel said to me , " Why are you amazed ? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and the seven-headed , ten-horned beast that carries her .
66018018	what		They cried out as they saw the smoke from her burning and said , ‘ What city was ever like the great city ? ’
